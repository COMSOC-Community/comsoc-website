<h1>Steering Committee</h1>

<p>The <a href="workshops.html">COMSOC workshop series</a> 
is coordinated by a Steering Committee.
This committee consists of four members of the COMSOC research
community. By default these are the PC chairs of the two previous
editions of the workshop, although the community may choose to appoint
alternative candidates during its Business Meeting at the workshop.</p>

<h3>Responsibilities of the Committee</h3>

<p>The role of the Steering Committee is (1) to select the venue and PC
chairs of the next edition of the workshop and (2) to ensure continuity
from one edition of the workshop to the next.</p>

<p>Regarding point (1), the Steering Committee will aim to decide on the
next venue and PC chairs at least 18 months before the event. The
preferred method for choosing a venue is by publicly soliciting bids to
host the workshop. One PC chair is usually affiliated with the hosting
institution; at least one of the two PC chairs should be a long-time
member of the COMSOC research community.</p>

<p>Regarding point (2), some of the characteristics of the COMSOC workshop
series are that COMSOC is an interdisciplinary, informal, and inclusive
event. Specifically, this means that there is no attempt to provide a
narrow definition of topics of interest; that both established
researchers and newcomers to the field can present their work; that
authors can expect to receive in-depth feedback on their papers from
the members of a dedicated PC; that there is no attempt to compete
with archival conferences; and that registration fees are very low
(i.e., organisers must find substantial sponsorship to be able to offer
an attractive programme with several high-profile invited speakers).</p>
