# Steering Committee

The [COMSOC workshop series](workshops.html) is coordinated by a Steering Committee. This committee consists of four members of the COMSOC research community. By default, these are the PC chairs of the two previous editions of the workshop, although the community may choose to appoint alternative candidates during its Business Meeting at the workshop.

## Responsibilities of the Committee

The role of the Steering Committee is to:
1. Select the venue and PC chairs of the next edition of the workshop.
2. Ensure continuity from one edition of the workshop to the next.

Regarding point (1), the Steering Committee will aim to decide on the next venue and PC chairs at least 18 months before the event. The preferred method for choosing a venue is by publicly soliciting bids to host the workshop. One PC chair is usually affiliated with the hosting institution; at least one of the two PC chairs should be a long-time member of the COMSOC research community.

Regarding point (2), some of the characteristics of the COMSOC workshop series are that COMSOC is an interdisciplinary, informal, and inclusive event. Specifically, this means that there is no attempt to provide a narrow definition of topics of interest; that both established researchers and newcomers to the field can present their work; that authors can expect to receive in-depth feedback on their papers from the members of a dedicated PC; that there is no attempt to compete with archival conferences; and that registration fees are very low (i.e., organizers must find substantial sponsorship to be able to offer an attractive program with several high-profile invited speakers).
