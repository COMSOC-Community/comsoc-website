# What is Computational Social Choice?

Computational social choice is an interdisciplinary field of study at the interface of social choice theory and computer science, fostering an exchange of ideas in both directions. On one hand, it applies techniques from computer science, such as complexity analysis and algorithm design, to study social choice mechanisms like voting procedures or fair division algorithms. On the other hand, it imports concepts from social choice theory into computing, applying them to problems in multiagent systems or network design.

Computational social choice integrates ideas from computer science, artificial intelligence, logic, political science, and economic theory. Below are some representative problems explored in the field.

## Social Choice and Theoretical Computer Science

Social choice theory focuses on designing and analyzing methods for collective decision-making, including voting protocols and procedures for fair resource division among agents. Classical work in the field establishes abstract results on the existence of procedures meeting certain requirements, often without considering computational aspects. Recent research in computer science addresses the computational viewpoint, exploring the tractability of manipulating voting protocols.

## Social Choice and Logic

Logic is applied to formally specify, verify, and analyze social procedures, known as "social software." Similar to how logic is used in computer science to specify system behavior, it can be used to define social procedures like voting protocols or fair division algorithms.

## Social Choice and Artificial Intelligence

Methods from social choice theory may face challenges when dealing with a large number of alternatives, especially those with combinatorial structures. Computational social choice addresses problems like negotiation over indivisible goods or committee elections, applying artificial intelligence and logic techniques for the compact representation of preferences.
