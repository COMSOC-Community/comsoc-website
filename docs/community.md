# The COMSOC Community

The COMSOC research community actively fosters collaboration through conferences, workshops, and other 
communication channels.

The computational social choice community is committed to fostering an inclusive environment that values 
the contributions of individuals from all backgrounds. We believe in the strength that arises from 
a multiplicity of perspectives and experiences. Our community is dedicated to creating a space
where everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, nationality, gender identity, sexual orientation, 
(dis)ability, age, religion, or socio-economic status, feels welcome, heard, and respected. 
Every member of the community is expected to act and behave in accordance with these principles and 
to provide equal opportunities for engagement, collaboration, and advancement within our community.

## Other Research Communities

Being a interdisciplinary research field, COMSOC relates to many other research communities.
The most important one being the social choice community. There are many exchange channels between
the two communities, notably through the events organised by the [Society for Social Choice and Welfare](https://scwsociety.org/).
