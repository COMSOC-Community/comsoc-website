# The COMSOC Community

The COMSOC research community is made up of a diverse group of individuals, 
defined by a common interest in the study of mechanisms for collective decision making. 
People regualrly meet in person and online, at a wide variety of events.

The COMSOC community is committed to fostering an inclusive environment that values 
the contributions of individuals from all backgrounds. We believe in the strength that arises from 
a multiplicity of perspectives and experiences. Our community is dedicated to creating a space
where everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, nationality, gender identity, sexual orientation, 
(dis)ability, age, religion, or socio-economic status, feels welcome, heard, and respected. 
Every member of the community is expected to act and behave in accordance with these principles and 
to provide equal opportunities for engagement, collaboration, and advancement within our community.
