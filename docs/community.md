# The COMSOC Community

The COMSOC research community actively fosters collaboration through conferences, workshops, and other 
communication channels. Events such as the [video seminars](video-seminar) and the [COMSOC workshops](/workshops)
are regular meetup points offering easy opportunities to exchange ideas.

The COMSOC community is committed to fostering an inclusive and diverse environment that values the
contributions of individuals from all backgrounds. We believe in the strength that arises from a
multiplicity of perspectives, experiences, and voices. Our community is dedicated to creating a space
where everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, age, or
socio-economic background, feels welcomed, heard, and respected. Every member of the community is
expected to act and behave in accordance with these principles and to provide equal opportunities for
engagement, collaboration, and advancement within our community.

## Mailing List

Join the [COMSOC mailing list](https://lists.duke.edu/sympa/info/comsoc){:target="_blank"} for announcements related to computational social choice, such as events and job opportunities. The list is managed by [Vincent Conitzer](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~conitzer/){:target="_blank"}.

## Steering Committee

The [COMSOC workshop series](workshops) is coordinated by a Steering Committee. This committee consists of four members of the COMSOC research community. By default, these are the PC chairs of the two previous editions of the workshop, although the community may choose to appoint alternative candidates during its Business Meeting at the workshop.

### Responsibilities of the Committee

The role of the Steering Committee is to:
1. Select the venue and PC chairs of the next edition of the workshop.
2. Ensure continuity from one edition of the workshop to the next.

Regarding point (1), the Steering Committee will aim to decide on the next venue and PC chairs at least 18 months before 
the event. The preferred method for choosing a venue is by publicly soliciting bids to host the workshop. One PC chair is
usually affiliated with the hosting institution; at least one of the two PC chairs should be a long-time member of the 
COMSOC research community.

Regarding point (2), some of the characteristics of the COMSOC workshop series are that COMSOC is an interdisciplinary, 
informal, and inclusive event. Specifically, this means that there is no attempt to provide a narrow definition of topics
of interest; that both established researchers and newcomers to the field can present their work; that authors can expect
to receive in-depth feedback on their papers from the members of a dedicated PC; that there is no attempt to compete with
archival conferences; and that registration fees are very low (i.e., organizers must find substantial sponsorship to be
able to offer an attractive program with several high-profile invited speakers).

## Related Research Communities

Being a interdisciplinary research field, COMSOC relates to many other research communities.
The most important one being the social choice community. There are many exchange channels between
the two communities, notably through the events organised by the [Society for Social Choice and Welfare](https://scwsociety.org/).
