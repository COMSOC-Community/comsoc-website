# The COMSOC Community

The COMSOC research community actively fosters collaboration through conferences, workshops, and other 
communication channels. Events such as the [video seminars](video-seminar) and the [COMSOC workshops](/workshops)
are regular meetup points offering easy opportunities to exchange ideas.

The COMSOC community is committed to fostering an inclusive and diverse environment that values the
contributions of individuals from all backgrounds. We believe in the strength that arises from a
multiplicity of perspectives, experiences, and voices. Our community is dedicated to creating a space
where everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, age, or
socio-economic background, feels welcomed, heard, and respected. Every member of the community is
expected to act and behave in accordance with these principles and to provide equal opportunities for
engagement, collaboration, and advancement within our community.

## Other Research Communities

Being a interdisciplinary research field, COMSOC relates to many other research communities.
The most important one being the social choice community. There are many exchange channels between
the two communities, notably through the events organised by the [Society for Social Choice and Welfare](https://scwsociety.org/).
