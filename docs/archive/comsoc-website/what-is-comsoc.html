<h1>What is Computational Social Choice?</h1>

<p>
Computational social choice is an interdisciplinary field of study 
at the interface of social choice theory and computer science,
promoting an exchange of ideas in both directions. On the one hand, it is
concerned with the application of techniques developed in computer science,
such as complexity analysis or algorithm design, to the study of social choice
mechanisms, such as voting procedures or fair division algorithms. On the
other hand, computational social choice is concerned with importing concepts
from social choice theory into computing. For instance, social welfare
orderings originally developed to analyse the quality of resource allocations
in human society are equally well applicable to problems in multiagent systems
or network design.
</p>

<p>
Computational social choice brings together ideas from computer science, 
artificial intelligence, logic, political science and economic theory, 
amongst others. Below we briefly introduce some representative problems 
that have been studied in the field.
</p>

<h3>Social Choice and Theoretical Computer Science</h3>

<p>
Social choice theory is concerned with the design and analysis of methods for 
collective decision making. Examples include in particular voting protocols,
but also procedures for fairly dividing a number of goods between several 
agents. Much classical work in the field has concentrated 
on establishing abstract results regarding the existence (or otherwise) of 
procedures meeting certain requirements, but such work has not usually taken 
computational issues into account. For instance, classical results in voting 
theory show that, under some weak and very natural conditions, it is impossible 
to design a voting protocol that voters cannot manipulate by reporting insincere 
preferences when casting their ballots. A voting system that induces such 
insincere voting behaviour cannot be expected to reliably return the socially 
most preferable candidate as a winner. In recent years, computer scientists have 
started to analyse this kind of problem from a computational point of view. 
The basic idea is that, should it be the case that 
manipulating successfully is a computationally intractable problem, 
manipulability may be less of a worry.
</p>

<h3>Social Choice and Logic</h3>

<p>
Another example for the application of tools typically used in computer science 
to problems stemming from economics and social choice is the use of logic for 
the formal specification and verification, or more generally analysis, of social 
procedures. In the same way as computer scientists have long been using logic to 
formally specify the behaviour of computer systems, so as to allow for the automatic 
verification of certain desirable properties of such systems, suitable logics may be 
used to specify social procedures such as voting protocols or fair division algorithms.
This line of research is also known as "social software".
</p> 

<h3>Social Choice and Artificial Intelligence</h3>

<p>
Known methods for collective decision making and classical results from social choice
theory may not always be applicable when the number of alternatives from which 
to choose is large. This may, for instance, be the case when these alternatives
have a combinatorial structure, as in negotiation over indivisible goods (where the
number of bundles an agent may obtain is exponential in the number of goods) or 
committee elections (where the number of possible committees is exponential in the 
number of seats to be filled). For such combinatorial problems, the mere representation
of the preferences of individuals over different alternatives becomes a non-trivial 
problem. A third example for work in computational social choice is then the 
application of techniques developed in artificial intelligence and logic for the 
compact representation of preferences to this kind of problem.
