<p>
Computational social choice is an interdisciplinary field of study 
at the interface of social choice theory and computer science,
promoting an exchange of ideas in both directions. On the one hand, it is
concerned with the application of techniques developed in computer science,
such as complexity analysis or algorithm design, to the study of social choice
mechanisms, such as voting procedures or fair division algorithms. On the
other hand, computational social choice is concerned with importing concepts
from social choice theory into computing. For instance, social welfare
orderings originally developed to analyse the quality of resource allocations
in human society are equally well applicable to problems in multiagent systems
or network design.
