CALL FOR BIDS TO HOST COMSOC-2023

We are now soliciting bids to host COMSOC-2023, the 9th International
Workshop on Computational Social Choice. In previous years, COMSOC has
been held as a 3/4-day meeting, attracting around 100 participants,
featuring 3-5 invited talks and 40-60 contributed papers. In 2008 and
2010 the workshop was preceded by an extra day devoted to introductory
tutorials, and in 2016 by an industry day. These events were attended by
more than half of the workshop participants. COMSOC-2021 was held in a
hybrid format due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

If you would like to host COMSOC-2023, please email your bid to:

- Reshef Meir <reshefm@ie.technion.ac.il> (primary contact for bidding)

or to one or more of the other members of the COMSOC steering committee:

- Bill Zwicker <zwickerw@union.edu>
- Edith Elkind <Edith.Elkind@cs.ox.ac.uk>
- Lirong Xia <xialirong@gmail.com>

The bid should arrive no later than *30 September 2022*. We encourage
everyone to apply, however please bear in mind the following:

We aim for COMSOC to move between areas geographically convenient for
large groups of the COMSOC community members. Since COMSOC-2018 took
place in North America and COMSOC-2021 was mostly online, we give
preference to locations outside North America.

If we receive several bids, we may offer one interested bidder to
organize COMSOC-2025. Please indicate in your bid if you would be
willing to host COMSOC-2025.

Your bid should consider the following issues:

(1) Location and facilities: Where do you propose to hold COMSOC-2023?
Please state both the city and the exact location, and comment on the
suitability of the available facilities (rooms) for the scientific
programme as well as the coffee breaks. Please also comment on
accessibility and attractiveness of the location, and on the
availability of suitable (including low budget) accommodation and
transport.

(2) Organization: Who would be the main local organizer of COMSOC-2023?
Which organization (e.g., university) would be hosting the workshop?
Please also comment on local research groups that would benefit from
attracting COMSOC.

(3) Schedule: What dates do you suggest? The workshop should take place
in or around May-September 2023. Are there any local constraints? Are
you aware of any other international events that may constrain the
choice of dates (see partial list below)? What schedule do you suggest
for the paper reviewing procedure?

(4) Budget: How do you intend to finance the workshop? Please provide a
preliminary budget. Expenses to keep in mind include: invited speakers;
coffee breaks; lunch; social dinner; possibly room and equipment hire;
possibly secretarial and administrative support; possibly a half-day
excursion. What level of registration fees do you anticipate and what
would they cover? Please make sure that the costs are as low as
possibly, preferably no higher than those for COMSOC-2018.

Finally, please include any other issues that you consider important.

All potential proposers are encouraged to contact us informally before
submitting their bid. Please do not hesitate to get in touch with any
questions that you may have.
