<h1>Registration</h1>

<p>
The registration fee is &euro;30 for (PhD) students,
and &euro;60 for everybody else. This covers access to 
all talks, coffee breaks, and a copy of the workshop notes.
We are also planning a <a href="dinner.php">social dinner</a>
which needs to be paid for separately (&euro;30).
</p>

<p>
Please register by <b>16 November 2006</b>.
Late registration is possible (at the same price), but for registrations 
received after this date we cannot promise to have enough copies of the
workshop notes available, and we may also be short of places for the
social dinner. 
</p>

<p>
To register, please fill in the 
<a href="form.php">registration form</a>.
Please pay the registration fee (<i>in cash</i>) on arrival at the 
workshop site. Students, please bring suitable proof of your student 
status with you.
