Preliminary information regarding the

1st International Workshop on Computational Social Choice (COMSOC-2006)
=======================================================================

Place: University of Amsterdam
Date:  6-8 December 2006

Computational social choice is a new discipline emerging at the interface 
of social choice theory and computer science. It is concerned with the 
application of computational techniques to the study of social choice 
mechanisms, and with the integration of social choice paradigms into 
computing. The aim of this workshop is to bring together the different 
communities that have been addressing such issues: computer scientists 
interested in computational issues in social choice; people working in 
artificial intelligence and multiagent systems who are using ideas from 
social choice to organise societies of artificial software agents; 
logicians interested in the logic-based specification and analysis of 
social procedures (social software); and last but not least people coming 
from social choice theory itself.
