<h1>Social Dinner</h1>

<p>
A social dinner is planned for Thursday night (7 December 2006).
We'll be going to an Indonesian restaurant to have <i>rijstafel</i>, 
by many considered to be the pinnacle of (colonial) Dutch cuisine.
The literal translation of <i>rijstafel</i> would be "rice table":
so there'll be <i>rice</i>, yes, as well a whole collection of  
small dishes covering the entire <i>table</i> (typically ranging from 
things such as spicy beef and grilled chicken, 
over vegtables in peanut sauce, to fried coconut powder).
</p>

<p>
The cost per dinner ticket is &euro;30 
(to be paid together with the registration fee). 
This covers the (extensive) meal, consisting of around 15 individual
dishes, and wine. To book a place for the dinner, please tick the 
appropriate box on the registration form. There is also a vegetarian 
option (please indicate on the form). 
</p>

<p>
The restaurant is called <i>Puri Mas</i> and the address is 
<i>Lange Leidsedwarsstraat 37-41</i>. This is just off <i>Leidseplein</i> 
(tram lines 1, 2, 5, 7 and 10), which can be found in the lower 
lefthand corner of <a href="amsterdam.pdf">this map</a>. 
Dinner starts at 20:00.
