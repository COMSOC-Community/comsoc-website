<h1>About COMSOC-2006 ...</h1>

<p>
<i>COMSOC-2006 is now over. The workshop has been attended by 80 participants 
from around the world. We would like to thank everyone involved for their
participation and support. -- Ulle &amp; J&eacute;r&ocirc;me</i>

<p>Computational social choice is a new discipline emerging at the 
interface  of  social  choice  theory  and  computer  science.  It  is 
concerned with the application  of  computational  techniques  to  the 
study of social choice mechanisms, and with the integration of  social 
choice paradigms into computing 
(<a href="background.php">read more</a>).</p>

<p>The 1st International Workshop on Computational Social Choice
(COMSOC-2006) will take place on 6-8 December 2006 in Amsterdam.
It will be hosted by the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation
(<a href="http://www.illc.uva.nl/">ILLC</a>) at the 
<a href="http://www.english.uva.nl/">University of Amsterdam</a>.
The aim of the workshop is to bring together different communities:
computer scientists  interested  in  computational  issues  in 
social choice; people working in artificial  intelligence  and
multiagent systems who are using  ideas  from  social  choice  to  organise 
societies of artificial software agents; logicians interested  in  the 
logic-based specification and analysis of  social  procedures  (social 
software); and last but not least people  coming  from  social  choice 
theory itself.</p>

<p>COMSOC-2006 is generously funded by several organisations, 
which will allow  us  to  bring in a number of prominent  scientists as
<a href="invited.php">invited speakers</a>, whilst 
keeping registration fees very low.</p>
