# About this Website

The original COMSOC community site was set up by Ulle Endriss in 2007 
and hosted at the University of Amsterdam until 2024 (see [archived version](archive/comsoc-website)). 

The site was redesigned from scratch by Simon Rey in 2024, 
with the goal of making it easier for everyone in the community to contribute content.
