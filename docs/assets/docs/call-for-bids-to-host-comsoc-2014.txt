CALL FOR BIDS TO HOST COMSOC-2014

We are now soliciting bids to host COMSOC-2014, the 5th International
Workshop on Computational Social Choice.  In the previous editions
(2006 in Amsterdam, 2008 in Liverpool, 2010 in Duesseldorf, and 2012
in Krakow), COMSOC has been held as a 3-day meeting, attracting
between roughly 80 and 100 participants, featuring 5 invited talks and
between around 35 and 40 contributed papers (all of which were
presented during plenary sessions).  In 2008 and 2010, the workshop
was preceded by an extra day devoted to introductory tutorials, which
were attended by around 50 participants each.

If you would like to propose to host COMSOC-2014, please email your
bid to the members of the COMSOC Steering Committee:
Felix Brandt <brandtf@in.tum.de>,
Joerg Rothe <rothe@cs.uni-duesseldorf.de>,
Piotr Faliszewski <faliszew@agh.edu.pl>, and
Vince Conitzer <conitzer@cs.duke.edu>
no later than 31 January 2013.  Your proposal should cover the
following issues:

(1) Location and facilities: Where do you propose to hold COMSOC-2014?
Please state both the city and the exact location, and comment on the
suitability of the available facilities (rooms) for the scientific
program as well as the coffee breaks.  Please also comment on
accessibility and attractiveness of the location, and on the
availability of suitable (including low budget) accommodation.

(2) Organisation: Who would be the main local organizer of
COMSOC-2014?  Which organization (e.g., university) would be hosting
the workshop?  Please also comment on local research groups that would
benefit from attracting COMSOC-2014.

(3) Schedule: What dates do you suggest?  The workshop should take
place between early summer and fall in 2014.  Are there any local
constraints?  Are you aware of any other international events that may
constrain the choice of dates?  What schedule do you suggest for the
paper reviewing procedure?

(4) Budget: How do you intend to finance the workshop?  Please provide
a preliminary budget.  Expenses to keep in mind include: invited
speakers; printing of proceedings; coffee breaks; lunch; social
dinner; possibly room and equipment hire; possibly secretarial and
administrative support.  What level of registration fees do you
anticipate and what would they cover?  (Please check out the previous
editions of COMSOC for comparison.)

Finally, please include any other issues that you consider important.

All potential proposers are encouraged to contact us informally before
submitting their bid.  Please do not hesitate to get in touch with any
questions that you may have.
