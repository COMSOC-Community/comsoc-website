    Preferential Voting Tools (pref_voting) is a Python library that can be used to study and run
    elections with different preferential voting methods (graded voting methods and cardinal voting
    methods are also included for comparison). In a preferential voting election, each voter
    submits a ranking of the candidates, and the winners are determined based on the submitted
    rankings. The rankings may include ties between candidates, and some candidates may be left
    off the ranking.

    Kendall distance, such as Kemeny consensus and Popular ranking, and trying to find solutions
    as efficiently as possible.
