      abstract: >
        We study the budget aggregation problem in which a set of strategic voters must split a finite divisible
        resource (such as money or time) among a set of competing projects. Our goal is twofold: We seek truthful
        mechanisms that provide fairness guarantees to the projects. For the first objective, we focus on the class
        of moving phantom mechanisms [Freeman et al., 2021], which are -- to this day -- essentially the only known
        truthful mechanisms in this setting. For project fairness, we consider the mean division as a fair baseline,
        and bound the maximum difference between the funding received by any project and this baseline. We propose
        a novel and simple moving phantom mechanism that provides optimal project fairness guarantees. As a corollary
        of our results, we show that our new mechanism minimizes the l1 distance to the mean for three projects and
        gives the first non-trivial bounds on this quantity for more than three projects.

    - title: "Fair Division With Imperfectly Rational Agents"
      speaker:
        name: "Alexandros Psomas"
        affiliation: "Purdue"
      abstract: >
        We consider the fundamental problem of allocating a set of indivisible goods among strategic agents with
        additive valuation functions. It is well known that, in the absence of monetary transfers, Pareto efficient
        and truthful rules are dictatorial, while there is no deterministic truthful mechanism that allocates all
        items and achieves envy-freeness up to one item (EF1), even for the case of two agents. The works I discuss
        in this talk stem from the observation that, in the context of fair division, truthfulness is used as a
        synonym for Dominant Strategy Incentive Compatibility (DSIC), requiring that an agent prefers reporting the
        truth, no matter what other agents report. In this talk, I will discuss two (incomparable) relaxations of
        DSIC: non-obvious manipulability (NOM) and Bayesian incentive compatibility (BIC), and show how these
        relaxations allow us to bypass the aforementioned negative results.

    - title: "Generative Social Choice"
      speaker:
        name: "Paul Gölz"
        affiliation: "SLMath"
      abstract: >
        Traditionally, social choice theory has only been applicable to choices among a few predetermined
        alternatives but not to more complex decisions such as collectively selecting a textual statement. We
        introduce generative social choice, a framework that combines the mathematical rigor of social choice theory
        with large language models’ capability to generate text and extrapolate preferences. This framework divides
        the design of AI-augmented democratic processes into two components: first, proving that the process satisfies
        rigorous representation guarantees when given access to oracle queries; second, empirically validating that
        these queries can be approximately implemented using a large language model. We illustrate this framework by
        applying it to the problem of generating a slate of statements that is representative of opinions expressed
        as free-form text, for instance in an online deliberative process.

    - title: "Learning-Augmented Mechanism Design"
      speaker:
        name: "Vasilis Gkatzelis"
        affiliation: "Drexel"
      abstract: >
        This talk will introduce the model of “learning-augmented mechanism design” (or “mechanism design with
        predictions”), which is an alternative model for the design and analysis of mechanisms in strategic settings.
        Aiming to complement the traditional approach in computer science, which analyzes the performance of algorithms
        based on worst-case instances, recent work on “algorithms with predictions” has developed algorithms that are
        enhanced with machine-learned predictions regarding the optimal solution. The algorithms can use this
        information to guide their decisions and the goal is to achieve much stronger performance guarantees when these
        predictions are accurate (consistency), while also maintaining good worst-case guarantees, even if these
        predictions are very inaccurate (robustness). This model has recently been used to analyze the fair allocation
        of goods that arrive in an online fashion, as well as to design voting rules that optimize for distortion.
        This talk will focus on the adaptation of this framework into mechanism design and specifically on the problem
        of strategic facility location.

    - title: "Plurality Veto and Beyond: On Natural and Practical Voting Rules with Optimal Metric Distortion"
      speaker:
        name: "Fatih Kızılkaya"
        affiliation: "USC"
      abstract: >
        The metric distortion framework posits that n voters and m candidates are jointly embedded in a metric space
        such that voters rank candidates that are closer to them higher. A voting rule’s purpose is to pick a candidate
        with minimum total distance to the voters, given only the rankings, but not the actual distances. As a result,
        in the worst case, each deterministic rule picks a candidate whose total distance is at least three times larger
        than that of an optimal one, i.e., has distortion at least 3. The recent breakthrough result of Gkatzelis et al.
        (FOCS’20) showed that the optimal distortion of 3 can be achieved by a mechanism called Plurality Matching.
        This rule is a complicated exhaustive search picking an arbitrary candidate for whom a certain candidate-specific
        bipartite graph contains a perfect matching. In our previous work (IJCAI’22), a much simpler rule called
        Plurality Veto was shown to achieve distortion 3 as well. This rule only constructs such a matching implicitly,
        but it, too, makes some arbitrary decisions affecting the outcome. Due to their inherent arbitrariness, both of
        these rules are not even remotely usable in practice without an independent arbitrator. In our most recent work
        (EC’23), we identify the underlying source of arbitrariness in these rules, which leads to a highly practical
        voting rule with optimal distortion 3 called Simultaneous Plurality Veto.  This rule is also intuitive and easy
        to explain:  Each candidate starts off with public support equal to his plurality score. From time 0 to 1, every
        voter continuously brings down, at rate 1, the support of her bottom choice among not-yet-eliminated
        candidates.  A candidate is eliminated if he is opposed by a voter after his support reaches 0. On top of being
        anonymous and neutral, the absence of arbitrary non-deterministic choices in this rule allows for the study of
        other axiomatic properties that are desirable in practice. We show that it also satisfies resolvability,
        monotonicity, majority, majority loser, mutual majority and reversal symmetry, in addition to still guaranteeing
        metric distortion 3.

    - title: "Condorcet consistency and pairwise justifiability under variable agendas"
      speaker:
        name: "Dolors Berga"
        affiliation: "Girona"
      abstract: >
        Consider the following principle regarding the performance of collective choice rules. "If a rule selects
        alternative x in situation 1, and alternative y in situation 2, there must be an alternative z, and some member
        of society whose appreciation of z relative to x has increased when going from situation 1 to situation 2."
        This principle requires a minimal justification for the fall of x in the consideration of society: someone must
        have decreased its appreciation relative to some other possible alternative. On appropriately restricted
        domains, pairwise justifiability, along with anonymity and neutrality, characterizes Condorcet consistent rules,
        thus providing a foundation for the choice of the alternatives that win by majority over all others in pairwise
        comparisons, when they exist. We study the consequences of imposing this requirement of pairwise justifiability
        on a large class of collective choice rules that includes social choice and social welfare functions as
        particular cases. When preference profiles are unrestricted, it implies dictatorship, and both Arrow's and the
        Gibbard-Satterthwaite's theorems become corollaries of our general result.

    - title: "Repeated Fair Allocation of Indivisible Items"
      speaker:
        name: "Oliviero Nardi"
        affiliation: "TU Wien"
      abstract: >
        The problem of fairly allocating a set of indivisible items is a well-known challenge in the field of
        (computational) social choice. In this scenario, there is a fundamental incompatibility between notions of
        fairness (such as envy-freeness and proportionality) and economic efficiency (such as Pareto-optimality).
        However, in the real world, items are not always allocated once and for all, but often repeatedly. For example,
        the items may be recurring chores to distribute in a household. Motivated by this, we initiate the study of the
        repeated fair division of indivisible goods and chores, and propose a formal model for this scenario. We show
        that, if the number of repetitions is a multiple of the number of agents, there always exists a sequence of
        allocations that is proportional and Pareto-optimal. On the other hand, irrespective of the number of
        repetitions, an envy-free and Pareto-optimal sequence of allocations may not exist. For the case of two agents,
        we show that if the number of repetitions is even, it is always possible to find a sequence of allocations that
        is overall envy-free and Pareto-optimal. We then prove even stronger fairness guarantees, showing that every
        allocation in such a sequence satisfies some relaxation of envy-freeness. Finally, in case the number of
        repetitions can be chosen freely, we show that envy-free and Pareto-optimal allocations are achievable for any
        number of agents.

    - title: "Algorithmic Contract Design"
      speaker:
        name: "Michal Feldman"
        affiliation: "Tel Aviv"
      abstract: >
        Contract design captures situations where a principal delegates the execution of a costly task to an agent. To
        complete the task, the agent chooses an action from a set of costly actions. The principal can only observe the
        outcome, which is stochastically determined by the chosen action. The principal incentivizes the desired action
        through a contract, that specifies payments based on the observed outcome. In this talk, I will survey two papers
        on *combinatorial* contracts, which highlight different sources of complexity that arise in contract design. The
        first (FOCS’21) is where the agent can choose any subset of a given set of actions; the second (STOC’23) is where
        the principal motivates a team of agents. We provide (approximation) algorithms and hardness results for the
        optimal contract problem in these scenarios.

    - title: "Fair Shares: Feasibility, Domination and Incentives"
      speaker:
        name: "Moshe Babaioff"
        affiliation: "Hebrew University"
      abstract: >
        We consider the problem of fairly allocating a set of indivisible goods to equally entitled agents, with no
        monetary transfers. A share function maps a pair of agent valuation and number of agents to a non-negative
        value, with the interpretation that if an allocation fails to give the agent a bundle of value at least equal
        to her share, this serves as evidence that the allocation is not fair towards the agent. We embark on a
        systematic study of feasible shares – a share is feasible if we can always give every agent her share. We
        introduce the notion of a self-maximizing share to capture the incentive for truthful valuation reporting.  We
        prove the inexistence of an “ultimate feasible share”: one that dominates any other feasible share that is
        self-maximizing. We then present several feasible shares that are self-maximizing and polynomial-time
        computable, and approximately dominate all other shares.

      speaker:
        name: "Niclas Boehmer"
        affiliation: "TU Berlin"
      abstract: >
        Robustness measures for election winners - such as the margin of victory, the score difference, or the minimum
        cost of a successful destructive bribery - are typically worst-case focused. In this talk, we explore a new
        average-case view on winner robustness by examining the winning probabilities of candidates when introducing
        random noise in the votes. Interestingly, computing these probabilities requires solving so far unexplored
        counting variants of established robustness-related decision problems. In an experimental analysis, we provide
        evidence that our average-case approach offers a new perspective that substantially differs from existing,
        worst-case-focused methods. We compare the robustness of different voting rules and evaluate the robustness of
        winners from the Formula 1 World Championship and some variants of real-world political elections. We find many
        instances of elections that have surprisingly non-robust winners and identify numerous delicate robustness
        patterns that cannot be identified using classic approaches. Finally, we describe how a similar approach can
        also be used to assess the robustness of funding decisions in participatory budgeting.

      speaker:

        affiliation: "TU Munich"
      abstract: >
        We study a dynamic matching procedure where homogeneous agents arrive at random according to a Poisson process
        and form edges at random yielding a sparse market. Agents leave according to a certain departure distribution and
        may leave early by forming a pair with a compatible agent. The primary objective is to maximize the number of
        matched agents. Our main result is to show that a mild condition on the departure distribution suffices to get
        almost optimal performance of instantaneous matching, despite operating in a thin market. We are thus the first
        to provide a natural condition under which instantaneous decisions are superior in a market that is both sparse
        and thin. This result is surprising because similar results in the previous literature are based on market
        thickness. In addition, instantaneous matching performs well with respect to further objectives such as
        minimizing waiting times and avoiding the risk of market congestion.

      speaker:
        name: "Daniel Halpern"
        affiliation: "Harvard"
      abstract: >
        Platforms for online civic participation rely heavily on methods for condensing thousands of comments into a
        relevant handful based on whether participants agree or disagree with them. We argue that these methods should
        guarantee fair representation of the participants, as their outcomes may affect the health of the conversation
        and inform impactful downstream decisions. To that end, we draw on the literature on approval-based committee
        elections. Our setting is novel in that the approval votes are incomplete since participants will typically not
        vote on all comments. We prove that this complication renders non-adaptive algorithms impractical in terms of
        the amount of information they must gather. Therefore, we develop an adaptive algorithm that uses information
        more efficiently by presenting incoming participants with statements that appear promising based on votes by
        previous participants. We prove that this method satisfies commonly used notions of fair representation, even
        when participants only vote on a small fraction of comments. Finally, an empirical evaluation on real data shows
        that the proposed algorithm provides representative outcomes in practice

      abstract: >
        How to evaluate and compare social prospects when there may be a risk on i) the actual allocation people will
        receive; ii) the existence of these future people; and iii) their preferences? This paper investigates this
        question that may arise when considering policies that endogenously affect future people, for instance climate
        policy. We show that there is no social ordering that meets minimal requirements of fairness, social
        rationality, and respect for people's ex ante preferences. We explore three ways to avoid this impossibility.
        First, if we drop the ex ante Pareto requirement, we can obtain fair ex post criteria that take an (arbitrary)
        expected utility of an equally-distributed equivalent level of well-being. Second, if the social ordering is not
        an expected utility, we can obtain fair ex ante criteria that assess uncertain individual prospects with a
        certainty-equivalent measure of well-being. Third, if we accept that interpersonal comparisons rely on VNM
        utility functions even in absence of risk, we can construct expected utility social orderings that satisfy of
        some version of Pareto ex ante.

        affiliation: "Paris"
      abstract: >
        The theory of repeated games offers a compelling rationale for cooperation in a variety of environments. Yet,
        its consequences for collective decision-making have been largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a
        general model of repeated voting in committees and study equilibrium behavior under alternative majority rules.
        Our main characterization reveals a complex, non-monotonic, relationship between the majority threshold, the
        preference distribution, and the optimal equilibrium outcome. In contrast with the stage-game equilibrium, the
        optimal equilibrium of the repeated game involves a form of implicit logroll, individuals sometimes voting
        against their preference to achieve the efficient decision. In turn, this affects the optimal voting rule, which
        may significantly differ from the optimal rule under sincere voting. We discuss implications for the design of
        repeated decision-making bodies.

        Consider settings in which agents with incomplete preferences need to make a collective decision, like a group of

        all options. We focus on a process of majority dynamics where issues are addressed one at a time and undecided agents 
        follow the opinion of the majority. We assess the effects of this process on various consensus notions—such as the 
        Condorcet winner—and show that in the worst case, myopic adherence to the majority damages existing consensus; yet, 
        simulation experiments indicate that the damage is often mild. We also examine scenarios where the chair of the decision 
        process can control the existence (or the identity) of consensus, by determining the order in which the issues are discussed.

        Division of house chores can be a great source of conflicts. For example, some studies have reported that inequity in the 
        division of household labor can cause significant stress to couples in the home. This raises the fundamental question of 
        how to divide chores. Fair division is a growing field in mathematics and computer science that provides an elegant 
        solution to this problem. It has been successfully implemented in various real-life applications, including the Adjusted 
        Winner Website, Fair Division Calculator, Course Match, and Spliddit. In this talk, I would like to present a new application 
        of fair division to the division of household chores. Our goal is to provide a systematic and transparent tool to divide 
        household chores and help create harmony in the home.

        name: "Alexandros Voudouris"
        affiliation: "Essex"
      abstract: >
        We extend the framework of metric distortion to multiwinner voting. There are n agents and m alternatives located in an 
        underlying metric space. The exact distances between agents and alternatives are unknown. Instead, each agent provides a 
        ranking of the alternatives, ordered from the closest to the farthest. Typically, the goal is to select a single alternative 
        that approximately minimizes the total distance from the agents, and the worst-case approximation ratio is termed distortion. 
        In the case of multiwinner voting, the goal is to select a committee of k alternatives that (approximately) minimizes the total 
        cost to all agents. We consider the scenario where the cost of an agent for a committee is her distance from her q-th favorite 
        alternative in the committee. We reveal a surprising trichotomy on the distortion of multiwinner voting rules in terms of k 
        and q: The distortion is unbounded when q ≤ k/3, asymptotically linear in the number of agents when k/3 < q ≤ k/2, and constant 
        when q > k/2.

      abstract: >
        Perpetual voting is a new formalism to support long-term collective decision making. The corresponding perpetual voting rules 
        take the history of previous decisions into account and---due to this additional information---can offer fairness guarantees 
        that are unachievable in single-shot decisions. In particular, such rules enable minorities to have a fair (proportional) 
        influence on the decision process and thus foster long-term participation. I will discuss strengths and caveats of perpetual 
        voting and present results of our axiomatic analysis.

      abstract: >
        We consider the problem of the conjoint selection and allocation of projects to a population of agents, e.g., students are 
        assigned papers and shall present them to their peers. The selection can be constrained either by quotas over subcategories 
        of projects or by the preferences of the agents themselves. In this context, we explore fairness and optimality issues. In 
        particular, we refine the analysis of the optimality concepts of rank-maximality and popularity, and show that they are 
        compatible with reasonable fairness requirements related to rank-based envy-freeness. Furthermore, we adapt the concept of 
        popularity in order to select globally good projects according to the preferences of the agents.

      speaker:
        name: "Matthias Bentert"
        affiliation: "TU Berlin"
      abstract: >
        Betweenness centrality measures the relative importance of a vertex in a graph in terms of how many shortest paths pass 
        through it. It is one of the most important concepts in network analysis and the well-known algorithm of Brandes [Journal of 
        Mathematical Sociology 2001] computes it in O(nm) time. While the running time is asymptotically optimal under the APSP 
        conjecture, significant empirical speedups were achieved in later work by preprocessing degree-one vertices and cut vertices. 
        The speedup can partially be explained by the fact that many real-world social networks follow a power-law degree distribution. 
        Going further in this direction, we present an algorithmic treatment of degree-two vertices and thereby prove an adaptive 
        running time bound in O(nk), where k < m is the feedback edge number of the input graph. To the best of our knowledge, this 
        is the first proven (parameterized) worst-case improvement over Brandes' upper bound.

        We consider the following decision-making scenario: a society of voters has to find an agreement on a set of proposals, 
        and every single proposal is to be accepted or rejected. Each voter supports a certain subset of the proposals—the favorite 
        ballot of this voter—and opposes the remaining ones. He accepts a ballot if he supports more than half of the proposals in 
        this ballot. The task is to decide whether there exists a ballot approving a specified number of selected proposals (agenda) 
        such that all voters (or a strict majority of them) accept this ballot.

      abstract: >
        We study the problem of fairly allocating indivisible items to agents with different entitlements, which captures, for example, 
        the distribution of ministries among political parties in a coalition government. Our focus is on picking sequences derived from 
        common apportionment methods, including five traditional divisor methods and the quota method. We paint a complete picture of these 
        methods in relation to known envy-freeness and proportionality relaxations for indivisible items as well as monotonicity properties 
        with respect to the resource, population, and weights. In addition, we provide characterizations of picking sequences satisfying each 
        of the fairness notions, and show that the well-studied maximum Nash welfare solution fails resource- and population-monotonicity 
        even in the unweighted setting. Our results serve as an argument in favor of using picking sequences in weighted fair division problems.

        Committee decisions on three or more alternatives depend on the adopted voting method and the underlying distribution of votes 
        (e.g., voting weights, party seats, individual shareholdings). Based on structural analysis of how voting weights affect the 
        aggregation of individual preferences into a collective decision and generalizations of the Penrose-Banzhaf and Shapley-Shubik 
        indices from binary votes to general social choice, we study the distribution of voting power and who benefits from adoption of a 
        particular voting rule (e.g., a plurality vote vs. plurality voting with a runoff vs. pairwise comparisons). We also investigate 
        the interaction of voting weights, voting method and the manipulability of committee decisions.

      speaker:
        name: "Kamesh Munagala"
        affiliation: "Duke"
      abstract: >
        We model the societal task of redistricting political districts as a fair partitioning problem: Given a set of n points in the plane, 
        each belonging to one of two parties, and a parameter k, our goal is to compute a partition of the plane into regions so that each 
        region contains roughly n/k points. The partition should satisfy a notion of ``local'' fairness, which is related to the notion of 
        core, a well-studied concept in cooperative game theory. A region is associated with the majority party for that region, and a point 
        in that region is ``unhappy" if it belongs to the minority party. A group of roughly n/k contiguous points is called a deviating 
        group with respect to the partition if a majority of points in this group are unhappy. The partition is locally fair if there is no 
        deviating group. The talk focuses on the case when points lie in one dimension, and the problem is non-trivial even in this case. 
        We consider both adversarial and ``beyond worst-case" settings for this problem. For the former, we characterize the input parameters 
        for which a locally fair partition always exists, and for which it does not. We then consider beyond worst case input models where 
        there are ``runs'' of red and blue points. For such clustered inputs, we show that an approximate locally fair partition exists if 
        we allow some regions to have smaller sizes. We also present a polynomial-time algorithm for computing a locally fair partition if 
        one exists. Time permitting, we will present preliminary empirical results on real-world maps.

      speaker:
        name: "Eric Neyman"
        affiliation: "Columbia"
      abstract: >
        The problem of aggregating expert forecasts is ubiquitous in fields as wide-ranging as machine learning, economics, climate science, 
        and national security. Despite this, our theoretical understanding of this question is fairly shallow. This paper initiates the study 
        of forecast aggregation in a context where experts' knowledge is chosen adversarially from a broad class of information structures. 
        While in full generality it is impossible to achieve a nontrivial performance guarantee, we show that doing so is possible under a 
        condition on the experts' information structure that we call projective substitutes. The projective substitutes condition is a notion 
        of informational substitutes: that there are diminishing marginal returns to learning the experts' signals. We show that under the 
        projective substitutes condition, taking the average of the experts' forecasts improves substantially upon the strategy of trusting a 
        random expert. We then consider a more permissive setting, in which the aggregator has access to the prior. We show that by averaging 
        the experts' forecasts and then extremizing the average by moving it away from the prior by a constant factor, the aggregator's 
        performance guarantee is substantially better than is possible without knowledge of the prior.

        In strategic candidacy games, both voters and candidates have preferences over the set of possible election outcomes, and candidates 
        may strategically withdraw from the election in order to manipulate the result in their favour. In this work, we extend the candidacy 
        game model to the setting of multiwinner elections, where the goal is to select a fixed-size subset of candidates (a committee), rather 
        than a single winner. We examine the existence and properties of Nash equilibria in the resulting class of games, under various voting 
        rules and voter preference structures.
