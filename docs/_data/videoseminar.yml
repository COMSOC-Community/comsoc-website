      abstract: >
        We study the budget aggregation problem in which a set of strategic voters must split a finite divisible
        resource (such as money or time) among a set of competing projects. Our goal is twofold: We seek truthful
        mechanisms that provide fairness guarantees to the projects. For the first objective, we focus on the class
        of moving phantom mechanisms [Freeman et al., 2021], which are -- to this day -- essentially the only known
        truthful mechanisms in this setting. For project fairness, we consider the mean division as a fair baseline,
        and bound the maximum difference between the funding received by any project and this baseline. We propose
        a novel and simple moving phantom mechanism that provides optimal project fairness guarantees. As a corollary
        of our results, we show that our new mechanism minimizes the l1 distance to the mean for three projects and
        gives the first non-trivial bounds on this quantity for more than three projects.

      abstract: >
        We consider the fundamental problem of allocating a set of indivisible goods among strategic agents with
        additive valuation functions. It is well known that, in the absence of monetary transfers, Pareto efficient
        and truthful rules are dictatorial, while there is no deterministic truthful mechanism that allocates all
        items and achieves envy-freeness up to one item (EF1), even for the case of two agents. The works I discuss
        in this talk stem from the observation that, in the context of fair division, truthfulness is used as a
        synonym for Dominant Strategy Incentive Compatibility (DSIC), requiring that an agent prefers reporting the
        truth, no matter what other agents report. In this talk, I will discuss two (incomparable) relaxations of
        DSIC: non-obvious manipulability (NOM) and Bayesian incentive compatibility (BIC), and show how these
        relaxations allow us to bypass the aforementioned negative results.

        Traditionally, social choice theory has only been applicable to choices among a few predetermined
        alternatives but not to more complex decisions such as collectively selecting a textual statement. We
        introduce generative social choice, a framework that combines the mathematical rigor of social choice theory
        with large language models’ capability to generate text and extrapolate preferences. This framework divides
        the design of AI-augmented democratic processes into two components: first, proving that the process satisfies
        rigorous representation guarantees when given access to oracle queries; second, empirically validating that
        these queries can be approximately implemented using a large language model. We illustrate this framework by
        applying it to the problem of generating a slate of statements that is representative of opinions expressed
        as free-form text, for instance in an online deliberative process.

    - title: "Learning-Augmented Mechanism Design"
      speaker:
        name: "Vasilis Gkatzelis"

        url: https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~vg399/
      abstract: >
        This talk will introduce the model of “learning-augmented mechanism design” (or “mechanism design with
        predictions”), which is an alternative model for the design and analysis of mechanisms in strategic settings.
        Aiming to complement the traditional approach in computer science, which analyzes the performance of algorithms
        based on worst-case instances, recent work on “algorithms with predictions” has developed algorithms that are
        enhanced with machine-learned predictions regarding the optimal solution. The algorithms can use this
        information to guide their decisions and the goal is to achieve much stronger performance guarantees when these
        predictions are accurate (consistency), while also maintaining good worst-case guarantees, even if these
        predictions are very inaccurate (robustness). This model has recently been used to analyze the fair allocation
        of goods that arrive in an online fashion, as well as to design voting rules that optimize for distortion.
        This talk will focus on the adaptation of this framework into mechanism design and specifically on the problem
        of strategic facility location.

    - title: "Plurality Veto and Beyond: On Natural and Practical Voting Rules with Optimal Metric Distortion"
      speaker:
        name: "Fatih Kızılkaya"
        affiliation: "USC"
        url: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=f_vqj2MAAAAJ&hl=en
      abstract: >
        The metric distortion framework posits that n voters and m candidates are jointly embedded in a metric space
        such that voters rank candidates that are closer to them higher. A voting rule’s purpose is to pick a candidate
        with minimum total distance to the voters, given only the rankings, but not the actual distances. As a result,
        in the worst case, each deterministic rule picks a candidate whose total distance is at least three times larger
        than that of an optimal one, i.e., has distortion at least 3. The recent breakthrough result of Gkatzelis et al.
        (FOCS’20) showed that the optimal distortion of 3 can be achieved by a mechanism called Plurality Matching.
        This rule is a complicated exhaustive search picking an arbitrary candidate for whom a certain candidate-specific
        bipartite graph contains a perfect matching. In our previous work (IJCAI’22), a much simpler rule called
        Plurality Veto was shown to achieve distortion 3 as well. This rule only constructs such a matching implicitly,
        but it, too, makes some arbitrary decisions affecting the outcome. Due to their inherent arbitrariness, both of
        these rules are not even remotely usable in practice without an independent arbitrator. In our most recent work
        (EC’23), we identify the underlying source of arbitrariness in these rules, which leads to a highly practical
        voting rule with optimal distortion 3 called Simultaneous Plurality Veto.  This rule is also intuitive and easy
        to explain:  Each candidate starts off with public support equal to his plurality score. From time 0 to 1, every
        voter continuously brings down, at rate 1, the support of her bottom choice among not-yet-eliminated
        candidates.  A candidate is eliminated if he is opposed by a voter after his support reaches 0. On top of being
        anonymous and neutral, the absence of arbitrary non-deterministic choices in this rule allows for the study of
        other axiomatic properties that are desirable in practice. We show that it also satisfies resolvability,
        monotonicity, majority, majority loser, mutual majority and reversal symmetry, in addition to still guaranteeing
        metric distortion 3.

        url: https://sites.google.com/view/dolorsberga/main-page
      abstract: >
        Consider the following principle regarding the performance of collective choice rules. "If a rule selects
        alternative x in situation 1, and alternative y in situation 2, there must be an alternative z, and some member
        of society whose appreciation of z relative to x has increased when going from situation 1 to situation 2."
        This principle requires a minimal justification for the fall of x in the consideration of society: someone must
        have decreased its appreciation relative to some other possible alternative. On appropriately restricted
        domains, pairwise justifiability, along with anonymity and neutrality, characterizes Condorcet consistent rules,
        thus providing a foundation for the choice of the alternatives that win by majority over all others in pairwise
        comparisons, when they exist. We study the consequences of imposing this requirement of pairwise justifiability
        on a large class of collective choice rules that includes social choice and social welfare functions as
        particular cases. When preference profiles are unrestricted, it implies dictatorship, and both Arrow's and the
        Gibbard-Satterthwaite's theorems become corollaries of our general result.

      speaker:
        name: "Oliviero Nardi"

        url: https://olinarr.github.io/
      abstract: >
        The problem of fairly allocating a set of indivisible items is a well-known challenge in the field of
        (computational) social choice. In this scenario, there is a fundamental incompatibility between notions of
        fairness (such as envy-freeness and proportionality) and economic efficiency (such as Pareto-optimality).
        However, in the real world, items are not always allocated once and for all, but often repeatedly. For example,
        the items may be recurring chores to distribute in a household. Motivated by this, we initiate the study of the
        repeated fair division of indivisible goods and chores, and propose a formal model for this scenario. We show
        that, if the number of repetitions is a multiple of the number of agents, there always exists a sequence of
        allocations that is proportional and Pareto-optimal. On the other hand, irrespective of the number of
        repetitions, an envy-free and Pareto-optimal sequence of allocations may not exist. For the case of two agents,
        we show that if the number of repetitions is even, it is always possible to find a sequence of allocations that
        is overall envy-free and Pareto-optimal. We then prove even stronger fairness guarantees, showing that every
        allocation in such a sequence satisfies some relaxation of envy-freeness. Finally, in case the number of
        repetitions can be chosen freely, we show that envy-free and Pareto-optimal allocations are achievable for any
        number of agents.

      abstract: >
        Contract design captures situations where a principal delegates the execution of a costly task to an agent. To
        complete the task, the agent chooses an action from a set of costly actions. The principal can only observe the
        outcome, which is stochastically determined by the chosen action. The principal incentivizes the desired action
        through a contract, that specifies payments based on the observed outcome. In this talk, I will survey two papers
        on *combinatorial* contracts, which highlight different sources of complexity that arise in contract design. The
        first (FOCS’21) is where the agent can choose any subset of a given set of actions; the second (STOC’23) is where
        the principal motivates a team of agents. We provide (approximation) algorithms and hardness results for the
        optimal contract problem in these scenarios.

        We consider the problem of fairly allocating a set of indivisible goods to equally entitled agents, with no
        monetary transfers. A share function maps a pair of agent valuation and number of agents to a non-negative
        value, with the interpretation that if an allocation fails to give the agent a bundle of value at least equal
        to her share, this serves as evidence that the allocation is not fair towards the agent. We embark on a
        systematic study of feasible shares – a share is feasible if we can always give every agent her share. We
        introduce the notion of a self-maximizing share to capture the incentive for truthful valuation reporting.  We
        prove the inexistence of an “ultimate feasible share”: one that dominates any other feasible share that is
        self-maximizing. We then present several feasible shares that are self-maximizing and polynomial-time
        computable, and approximately dominate all other shares.

        Robustness measures for election winners - such as the margin of victory, the score difference, or the minimum
        cost of a successful destructive bribery - are typically worst-case focused. In this talk, we explore a new
        average-case view on winner robustness by examining the winning probabilities of candidates when introducing
        random noise in the votes. Interestingly, computing these probabilities requires solving so far unexplored
        counting variants of established robustness-related decision problems. In an experimental analysis, we provide
        evidence that our average-case approach offers a new perspective that substantially differs from existing,
        worst-case-focused methods. We compare the robustness of different voting rules and evaluate the robustness of
        winners from the Formula 1 World Championship and some variants of real-world political elections. We find many
        instances of elections that have surprisingly non-robust winners and identify numerous delicate robustness
        patterns that cannot be identified using classic approaches. Finally, we describe how a similar approach can
        also be used to assess the robustness of funding decisions in participatory budgeting.

      abstract: >
        Fair division of indivisible items encompasses a wide range of real-world applications. The discrete nature of this problem
        has given rise to several intriguing approximate notions such as envy-freeness up to any item (EFX), envy-freeness up to one
        item (EF1), and maximin share guarantee (MMS).  In this talk, I will focus on fair allocation of mixture of goods and chores under
        lexicographic preferences. I will argue that this class of preferences is natural, common in computational social choice and AI,
        and more importantly, elevates our understanding of computational and structural challenges in achieving fairness.  In particular,
        I will i) demonstrate the non-existence and intractability of achieving EFX, ii) identify natural subclasses of preferences for which
        positive results can be obtained (along with Pareto optimality), and iii) discuss some of the remaining challenges in achieving other
        fairness notions and pushing beyond this domain. The negative results immediately carry over to additive valuations while the positive
        results highlight the challenges of achieving fair and efficient allocations of mixed items.

      abstract: >
        We study a dynamic matching procedure where homogeneous agents arrive at random according to a Poisson process
        and form edges at random yielding a sparse market. Agents leave according to a certain departure distribution and
        may leave early by forming a pair with a compatible agent. The primary objective is to maximize the number of
        matched agents. Our main result is to show that a mild condition on the departure distribution suffices to get
        almost optimal performance of instantaneous matching, despite operating in a thin market. We are thus the first
        to provide a natural condition under which instantaneous decisions are superior in a market that is both sparse
        and thin. This result is surprising because similar results in the previous literature are based on market
        thickness. In addition, instantaneous matching performs well with respect to further objectives such as
        minimizing waiting times and avoiding the risk of market congestion.

        Platforms for online civic participation rely heavily on methods for condensing thousands of comments into a
        relevant handful based on whether participants agree or disagree with them. We argue that these methods should
        guarantee fair representation of the participants, as their outcomes may affect the health of the conversation
        and inform impactful downstream decisions. To that end, we draw on the literature on approval-based committee
        elections. Our setting is novel in that the approval votes are incomplete since participants will typically not
        vote on all comments. We prove that this complication renders non-adaptive algorithms impractical in terms of
        the amount of information they must gather. Therefore, we develop an adaptive algorithm that uses information
        more efficiently by presenting incoming participants with statements that appear promising based on votes by
        previous participants. We prove that this method satisfies commonly used notions of fair representation, even
        when participants only vote on a small fraction of comments. Finally, an empirical evaluation on real data shows
        that the proposed algorithm provides representative outcomes in practice

        How to evaluate and compare social prospects when there may be a risk on i) the actual allocation people will
        receive; ii) the existence of these future people; and iii) their preferences? This paper investigates this
        question that may arise when considering policies that endogenously affect future people, for instance climate
        policy. We show that there is no social ordering that meets minimal requirements of fairness, social
        rationality, and respect for people's ex ante preferences. We explore three ways to avoid this impossibility.
        First, if we drop the ex ante Pareto requirement, we can obtain fair ex post criteria that take an (arbitrary)
        expected utility of an equally-distributed equivalent level of well-being. Second, if the social ordering is not
        an expected utility, we can obtain fair ex ante criteria that assess uncertain individual prospects with a
        certainty-equivalent measure of well-being. Third, if we accept that interpersonal comparisons rely on VNM
        utility functions even in absence of risk, we can construct expected utility social orderings that satisfy of
        some version of Pareto ex ante.

        The theory of repeated games offers a compelling rationale for cooperation in a variety of environments. Yet,
        its consequences for collective decision-making have been largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a
        general model of repeated voting in committees and study equilibrium behavior under alternative majority rules.
        Our main characterization reveals a complex, non-monotonic, relationship between the majority threshold, the
        preference distribution, and the optimal equilibrium outcome. In contrast with the stage-game equilibrium, the
        optimal equilibrium of the repeated game involves a form of implicit logroll, individuals sometimes voting
        against their preference to achieve the efficient decision. In turn, this affects the optimal voting rule, which
        may significantly differ from the optimal rule under sincere voting. We discuss implications for the design of
        repeated decision-making bodies.

        Consider settings in which agents with incomplete preferences need to make a collective decision, like a group of

        Condorcet winner—and show that in the worst case, myopic adherence to the majority damages existing consensus; yet, 
        simulation experiments indicate that the damage is often mild. We also examine scenarios where the chair of the decision 
        process can control the existence (or the identity) of consensus, by determining the order in which the issues are discussed.

        In this talk I will introduce on-going work on establishing formal relationships between weighted majority elections 
        and information markets in a binary truth-tracking setting. I will present correspondence results showing how weighted 
        majority elections and specific classes of information markets implement the same collective truth-tracking behaviour. 
        The aim is to provide common foundations to both elections and information markets in the framework of epistemic social choice.

        Proposals to change the size of the Congress, update ballot types, channel decisions through citizens' assemblies or 
        participatory budgeting are being actively researched and tested. Liquid democracy is making its way to the democratic 
        innovation table as a model that may stand for non-active stakeholders and enhance collective intelligence using the 
        wealth of inter-personnel information embedded in social networks. Yet, much uncertainty remains about its propensity to 
        concentrate voting power in the hands of a few, its likelihood to ease vote buying, or to create problematic (e.g., cyclical) 
        delegations. In this talk, I will review what we currently understand theoretically and empirically about liquid democracy 
        and interpret how that informs further real-world testing and deployment of liquid democratic procedures.

      abstract: >
        Division of house chores can be a great source of conflicts. For example, some studies have reported that inequity in the 
        division of household labor can cause significant stress to couples in the home. This raises the fundamental question of 
        how to divide chores. Fair division is a growing field in mathematics and computer science that provides an elegant 
        solution to this problem. It has been successfully implemented in various real-life applications, including the Adjusted 
        Winner Website, Fair Division Calculator, Course Match, and Spliddit. In this talk, I would like to present a new application 
        of fair division to the division of household chores. Our goal is to provide a systematic and transparent tool to divide 
        household chores and help create harmony in the home.

      abstract: >
        We extend the framework of metric distortion to multiwinner voting. There are n agents and m alternatives located in an 
        underlying metric space. The exact distances between agents and alternatives are unknown. Instead, each agent provides a 
        ranking of the alternatives, ordered from the closest to the farthest. Typically, the goal is to select a single alternative 
        that approximately minimizes the total distance from the agents, and the worst-case approximation ratio is termed distortion. 
        In the case of multiwinner voting, the goal is to select a committee of k alternatives that (approximately) minimizes the total 
        cost to all agents. We consider the scenario where the cost of an agent for a committee is her distance from her q-th favorite 
        alternative in the committee. We reveal a surprising trichotomy on the distortion of multiwinner voting rules in terms of k 
        and q: The distortion is unbounded when q ≤ k/3, asymptotically linear in the number of agents when k/3 < q ≤ k/2, and constant 
        when q > k/2.

        Perpetual voting is a new formalism to support long-term collective decision making. The corresponding perpetual voting rules 
        take the history of previous decisions into account and---due to this additional information---can offer fairness guarantees 
        that are unachievable in single-shot decisions. In particular, such rules enable minorities to have a fair (proportional) 
        influence on the decision process and thus foster long-term participation. I will discuss strengths and caveats of perpetual 
        voting and present results of our axiomatic analysis.

        of projects or by the preferences of the agents themselves. In this context, we explore fairness and optimality issues. In 
        particular, we refine the analysis of the optimality concepts of rank-maximality and popularity, and show that they are 
        compatible with reasonable fairness requirements related to rank-based envy-freeness. Furthermore, we adapt the concept of 
        popularity in order to select globally good projects according to the preferences of the agents.

      abstract: >
        Betweenness centrality measures the relative importance of a vertex in a graph in terms of how many shortest paths pass 
        through it. It is one of the most important concepts in network analysis and the well-known algorithm of Brandes [Journal of 
        Mathematical Sociology 2001] computes it in O(nm) time. While the running time is asymptotically optimal under the APSP 
        conjecture, significant empirical speedups were achieved in later work by preprocessing degree-one vertices and cut vertices. 
        The speedup can partially be explained by the fact that many real-world social networks follow a power-law degree distribution. 
        Going further in this direction, we present an algorithmic treatment of degree-two vertices and thereby prove an adaptive 
        running time bound in O(nk), where k < m is the feedback edge number of the input graph. To the best of our knowledge, this 
        is the first proven (parameterized) worst-case improvement over Brandes' upper bound.

        ballot of this voter—and opposes the remaining ones. He accepts a ballot if he supports more than half of the proposals in 
        this ballot. The task is to decide whether there exists a ballot approving a specified number of selected proposals (agenda)

        We study the problem of fairly allocating indivisible items to agents with different entitlements, which captures, for example, 
        the distribution of ministries among political parties in a coalition government. Our focus is on picking sequences derived from 
        common apportionment methods, including five traditional divisor methods and the quota method. We paint a complete picture of these 
        methods in relation to known envy-freeness and proportionality relaxations for indivisible items as well as monotonicity properties 
        with respect to the resource, population, and weights. In addition, we provide characterizations of picking sequences satisfying each 
        of the fairness notions, and show that the well-studied maximum Nash welfare solution fails resource- and population-monotonicity 
        even in the unweighted setting. Our results serve as an argument in favor of using picking sequences in weighted fair division problems.

        Committee decisions on three or more alternatives depend on the adopted voting method and the underlying distribution of votes 
        (e.g., voting weights, party seats, individual shareholdings). Based on structural analysis of how voting weights affect the 
        aggregation of individual preferences into a collective decision and generalizations of the Penrose-Banzhaf and Shapley-Shubik 
        indices from binary votes to general social choice, we study the distribution of voting power and who benefits from adoption of a 
        particular voting rule (e.g., a plurality vote vs. plurality voting with a runoff vs. pairwise comparisons). We also investigate 
        the interaction of voting weights, voting method and the manipulability of committee decisions.

      abstract: >
        We model the societal task of redistricting political districts as a fair partitioning problem: Given a set of n points in the plane, 
        each belonging to one of two parties, and a parameter k, our goal is to compute a partition of the plane into regions so that each 
        region contains roughly n/k points. The partition should satisfy a notion of 'local' fairness, which is related to the notion of 
        core, a well-studied concept in cooperative game theory. A region is associated with the majority party for that region, and a point 
        in that region is 'unhappy' if it belongs to the minority party. A group of roughly n/k contiguous points is called a deviating 
        group with respect to the partition if a majority of points in this group are unhappy. The partition is locally fair if there is no 
        deviating group. The talk focuses on the case when points lie in one dimension, and the problem is non-trivial even in this case. 
        We consider both adversarial and 'beyond worst-case' settings for this problem. For the former, we characterize the input parameters 
        for which a locally fair partition always exists, and for which it does not. We then consider beyond worst case input models where 
        there are 'runs' of red and blue points. For such clustered inputs, we show that an approximate locally fair partition exists if 
        we allow some regions to have smaller sizes. We also present a polynomial-time algorithm for computing a locally fair partition if 
        one exists. Time permitting, we will present preliminary empirical results on real-world maps.

      abstract: >
        The problem of aggregating expert forecasts is ubiquitous in fields as wide-ranging as machine learning, economics, climate science, 
        and national security. Despite this, our theoretical understanding of this question is fairly shallow. This paper initiates the study 
        of forecast aggregation in a context where experts' knowledge is chosen adversarially from a broad class of information structures. 
        While in full generality it is impossible to achieve a nontrivial performance guarantee, we show that doing so is possible under a 
        condition on the experts' information structure that we call projective substitutes. The projective substitutes condition is a notion 
        of informational substitutes: that there are diminishing marginal returns to learning the experts' signals. We show that under the 
        projective substitutes condition, taking the average of the experts' forecasts improves substantially upon the strategy of trusting a 
        random expert. We then consider a more permissive setting, in which the aggregator has access to the prior. We show that by averaging 
        the experts' forecasts and then extremizing the average by moving it away from the prior by a constant factor, the aggregator's 
        performance guarantee is substantially better than is possible without knowledge of the prior.

        Rationing of healthcare resources has emerged as an important issue, which has been discussed by medical experts, policy-makers, and the general

        and each category has a priority ranking of the patients. We present an allocation rule that respects the priorities, complies with the eligibility
        requirements, allocates the largest feasible number of units, and does not incentivize agents to hide that they qualify through a category. The
        rule characterizes all possible allocations that satisfy the first three properties and is polynomial-time computable.

        game model to the setting of multiwinner elections, where the goal is to select a fixed-size subset of candidates (a committee), rather 
        than a single winner. We examine the existence and properties of Nash equilibria in the resulting class of games, under various voting 
        rules and voter preference structures.

        url: https://cs.au.dk/~iannis/
      abstract: >
        We study the PAC learnability of multiwinner voting, focusing on the class of approval-based committee scoring (ABCS) rules. These are
        voting rules applied on profiles with approval ballots, where each voter approves some of the candidates. ABCS rules adapt positional
        scoring rules in single-winner voting by assuming that each committee of k candidates collects from each voter a score, that depends on
        the size of the voter's ballot and on the size of its intersection with the committee. Then, committees of maximum score are the winning ones.
        Our goal is to learn a target rule (i.e., to learn the corresponding scoring function) using information about the winning committees of a small
        number of sampled profiles. Despite the existence of exponentially many outcomes compared to single-winner elections, we show that the sample
        complexity is still low: a polynomial number of samples carries enough information for learning the target committee with high confidence and accuracy.
        Unfortunately, even simple tasks that need to be solved for learning from these samples are intractable. We prove that deciding whether there exists some
        ABCS rule that makes a given committee winning in a given profile is a computationally hard problem. Our results extend to the class of sequential Thiele
        rules, which have received attention due to their simplicity.

        and consensus division. As this is a work in progress, the talk will contain more questions than answers.

        Gibbard and Satterthwaite have shown that the only single-valued social choice functions (SCFs) that satisfy non-imposition (i.e., 
        the function’s range coincides with its codomain) and strategyproofness (i.e., voters are never better off by misrepresenting their 
        preferences) are dictatorships. In this paper, we consider set-valued social choice correspondences (SCCs) that are strategyproof according
        to Fishburn's preference extension and, in particular, the top cycle, an attractive SCC that returns the maximal elements of the transitive
        closure of the weak majority relation. Our main theorem implies that, under mild conditions, the top cycle is the only non-imposing 
        strategyproof SCC whose outcome only depends on the quantified pairwise comparisons between alternatives. This result effectively turns the 
        Gibbard-Satterthwaite impossibility into a complete characterization of the top cycle by moving from SCFs to SCCs. It is obtained as a corollary
        of a more general characterization of strategyproof SCCs.

      abstract: >
        With very few exceptions, recent research in fair division has mostly focused on deterministic allocations. Deviating from this trend,
        we study the fairness notion of interim envy-freeness (iEF) for lotteries over allocations, which serves as a sweet spot between the too
        stringent notion of ex-post envy-freeness and the very weak notion of ex-ante envy-freeness. iEF is a natural generalization of envy-freeness
        to random allocations in the sense that a deterministic envy-free allocation is iEF (when viewed as a degenerate lottery). It is also certainly
        meaningful as it allows for a richer solution space, which includes solutions that are provably better than envy-freeness according to several
        criteria. Our analysis relates iEF to other fairness notions as well, and reveals tradeoffs between iEF and efficiency. Even though several of
        our results apply to general fair division problems, we are particularly interested in instances with equal numbers of agents and items where
        allocations are perfect matchings of the items to the agents. Envy-freeness can be trivially decided and (when it can be achieved, it) implies
        full efficiency in this setting. Although computing iEF allocations in matching allocation instances is considerably more challenging, we show
        how to compute them in polynomial time, while also maximizing several efficiency objectives. Our algorithms use the ellipsoid method for linear
        programming and efficient solutions to a novel variant of the bipartite matching problem as a separation oracle. We also study the extension of
        interim envy-freeness notion when payments to or from the agents are allowed. We present a series of results on two optimization problems, including
        a generalization of the classical rent division problem to random allocations using interim envy-freeness as the solution concept.

        We study generalizations of stable matching in which agents may be matched fractionally; this models time-sharing assignments. We focus on the so-called 
        ordinal stability and cardinal stability, and investigate the computational complexity of finding an ordinally stable or cardinally stable fractional 
        matching which either maximizes the social welfare (i.e., the overall utilities of the agents) or the number of fully matched agents (i.e., agents whose 
        matching values sum up to one). We complete the complexity classification of both optimization problems for both ordinal stability and cardinal stability,
        distinguishing between the marriage (bipartite) and roommates (non-bipartite) cases and the presence or absence of ties in the preferences. In particular,
        we prove a surprising result that finding a cardinally stable fractional matching with maximum social welfare is NP-hard even for the marriage case 
        without ties. This answers an open question and exemplifies a rare variant of stable marriage that remains hard for preferences without ties. We also 
        complete the picture of the relations of the stability notions and derive structural properties.

        In the random assignment problem, there are n agents and n indivisible objects.  Each agent has a preference ordering over the objects.  We seek a method 
        of assigning one object to each agent, using some randomisation to achieve fairness.  The central solutions in the literature are Random Priority and the 
        Serial Rule.  In this talk, I will propose a new fairness principle and solution for this problem.

        Complexity of voting manipulation is one of the most important topics in computational social choice. In this talk, two new approaches to this problem 
        will be shown. In the beginning a two-stage voting manipulation scenario will be considered. First, a malicious party (an attacker) attempts to manipulate
        the election outcome in favor of a preferred candidate by changing the vote counts in some of the voting districts. Afterwards, another party (a 
        defender), which cares about the voters' wishes, demands a recount in a subset of the manipulated districts, restoring their vote counts to their original
        values. The resulting Stackelberg game for the case where votes are aggregated using two variants of the Plurality rule will be described, and an almost 
        complete picture of the complexity landscape will be shown, both from the attacker's and from the defender's perspective. In the second part of talk the 
        computational problem of constructive election control via issue selection will be covered. In this problem, a party decides which political issues to 
        focus on to ensure victory for the favored candidate.

        We consider a set of voters making a collective decision via simultaneous vote on two binary issues. Voters' preferences are captured by payoffs assigned 
        to combinations of outcomes for each issue and they can be nonseparable: a voter's preference over an issue might be dependent on the other issue. When 
        the collective decision in this context is reached by voting on both issues at the same time, multiple election paradoxes may arise, as studied 
        extensively in the theoretical literature. In this paper we pursue an experimental approach and investigate the impact of iterative voting, in which 
        groups deliberate by repeating the voting process until a final outcome is reached. Our results from experiments run in the lab show that voters tend to 
        have an optimistic rather than a pessimistic behaviour when casting a vote on a non-separable issue and that iterated voting may in fact improve the 
        social outcome. We provide the first comprehensive empirical analysis of individual and collective behavior in the multiple referendum setting.

      abstract: >
        Defenders of the Electoral College routinely invoke a traditional argument to reject proposals for a national popular vote. Granted, they say, Florida in
        2000 was a national nightmare, but the agony would be far greater if such a dispute extended over the entire nation.  Proponents of a direct vote reply by
        conjecturing that the Electoral College increases the frequency of disputable elections.  Indeed, the 2020 US presidential election was another instance 
        of disputable election on the legal front.  We investigate whether we should expect disputable outcomes to be more frequent under the present US indirect 
        system as compared with a direct vote and, if so, by how much.   We use two methods: an historical analysis of actual outcomes in presidential elections,
        and an a priori formal model borrowed from Social Choice Theory (IAC).  Depending on the thresholds one posits for disputability, the historical analysis 
        shows that disputable elections have been about two to six times more frequent under the Electoral College. In a model where all the states have the same 
        population the IAC model produces an impressively compatible intermediate ratio of 4:1. We also explore the impact of differences in the population of the
        states on the likelihood of legal disputes.

      abstract: >
        In many real world situations, collective decisions are made using voting and, in scenarios such as committee or board elections, employing voting rules
        that return multiple winners. In multi-winner approval voting (AV), an agent submits a ballot consisting of approvals for as many candidates as they wish
        , and winners are chosen by tallying up the votes and choosing the top-k candidates receiving the most approvals. In many scenarios, an agent may 
        manipulate the ballot they submit in order to achieve a better outcome by voting in a way that does not reflect their true preferences. In complex and 
        uncertain situations, agents may use heuristics instead of incurring the additional effort required to compute the manipulation which most favors them. In
        this paper, we examine voting behavior in single-winner and multi-winner approval voting scenarios with varying degrees of uncertainty using behavioral 
        data obtained from Mechanical Turk. We find that people generally manipulate their vote to obtain a better outcome, but often do not identify the optimal 
        manipulation. There are a number of predictive models of agent behavior in the social choice and psychology literature that are based on cognitively 
        plausible heuristic strategies.  We show that the existing approaches do not adequately model our real-world data. We propose a novel model that takes 
        into account the size of the winning set and human cognitive constraints; and demonstrate that this model is more effective at capturing real-world 
        behaviors in multi-winner approval voting scenarios.

      abstract: >
        Gale and Shapley introduced a matching problem between two sets of agents where each agent on one side has an exogenous preference over the agents of the
        other side. They defined a matching as stable if no unmatched pair can both improve their utility by forming a new pair. They proved, algorithmically, 
        the existence of a stable matching. Shapley and Shubik, as well as many others, extended the model by allowing monetary transfers. We offer a further 
        extension by assuming that matched couples obtain their payoff endogenously as the outcome of a strategic game they have to play in a usual 
        non-cooperative sense (without commitment) or in a semi-cooperative way (with commitment, as the outcome of a bilateral binding contract in which each 
        player is responsible of his/her part of the contract). Depending on whether the players can commit or not, we define in each case a solution concept 
        which combines Gale-Shapley pairwise external stability with a (generalized) Nash equilibrium internal stability. In each case, we give the necessary 
        and sufficient conditions for the set of stable allocations to be non-empty, we study its geometry (full/semi-lattice), and provide an algorithm which 
        converges to its maximal element. Finally, we prove that our second model—with commitment—encompasses and refines most of the literature (matching with 
        monetary transfers as well as matching with contracts).

      abstract: >
        A number of citation indices have been proposed for measuring and ranking the research publication records of scholars. Some of the best-known indices, 
        such as those proposed by Hirsch and Woeginger, are designed to reward most highly those records that strike some balance between productivity (number of
        papers published) and impact (frequency with which those papers are cited). A large number of rarely cited publications will not score well, nor will a 
        very small number of heavily cited papers. We propose several new citation indices, each resting on the notion of scale invariance, as introduced by John 
        Nash in his solution of the two-person bargaining problem. Our main focus is on one of these—a scale invariant version of the Hirsch index. We argue that 
        it has advantages over the original; it produces fairer rankings within subdisciplines, is more decisive (discriminates more finely, yielding fewer ties)
        and more dynamic (growing over time via more frequent, smaller increments). Simulations with Poisson noise suggest that scale invariance reduces the 
        number of "accidental" reversals, wherein random irregularities cause researcher A to receive a lower index value than B, although A's productivity and 
        impact are both slightly higher than B's. Moreover, we provide an axiomatic characterization of the scale invariant Hirsch index, via axioms that bear a 
        close relationship, in discrete analogue, to those used by Nash. This argues for the mathematical naturality of the new index.

        Sen introduced the gamma condition, also known as expansion consistency, as  part of a  characterization of  choice functions representable by a binary 
        relation. Following Bordes, we consider expansion as an axiom on voting methods—as well as a natural weakening of expansion hinted at by Bordes, which we
        call binary expansion.   Surveying standard voting methods, there is an apparent connection between the degree of resoluteness of a voting method and 
        whether it satisfies (binary) expansion.   We explain this observation with a new impossibility theorem: There is no voting method satisfying anonymity,
        neutrality, binary expansion, and an axiom we call quasi-resoluteness, which requires a single winner in any profile without tied margins. Finally, we 
        explore the frequency with which some voting methods violate binary expansion using computer simulations.

        We investigate the practical aspects of computing the necessary and possible winners in elections over incomplete voter preferences. In the case of the 
        necessary winners, we show how to implement and accelerate the polynomial-time algorithm of Xia and Conitzer.  In the case of the possible winners, where
        the problem is NP-hard, we give a natural reduction to Integer Linear Programming (ILP) for all positional scoring rules and implement it in a leading 
        commercial optimization solver.  Further, we devise optimization techniques to minimize the number of ILP executions and, oftentimes, avoid them 
        altogether. We conduct a thorough experimental study that includes the construction of a rich benchmark of election data based on real and synthetic 
        data.  Our  findings suggest that, the worst-case intractability of the possible winners notwithstanding, the algorithmic techniques presented here
        scale well and can be used to compute the possible winners in realistic scenarios.

        Election databases are the main elements of a new framework that aims to create bridges between the computational social choice and the data management 
        communities. An election database contains incomplete information about the preferences of voters (in the form of partial orders), alongside with
        standard database relations that provide contextual information.  The availability of the relational context allows for the formulation of sophisticated
        queries about voting rules, candidates, winners, issues, and positions on issues. We introduce the necessary answer semantics and the possible answer 
        semantics to queries on election databases and explore the computational complexity of query evaluation under these semantics.

        Consider an urn filled with balls, each labelled with one of several possible collective decisions. Now, draw two balls from the urn, let a random

        and repeat. In order to prevent the permanent disappearance of some types of balls, a randomly drawn ball is labelled with a random collective 
        decision once in a while. We prove that the empirical distribution of collective decisions converges towards the outcome of a celebrated 
        probabilistic voting rule proposed by Peter C. Fishburn (Rev. Econ. Stud., 51(4), 1984). The proposed procedure has analogues in nature recently
        studied in biology, physics, and chemistry. It is more flexible than traditional voting rules because it does not require a central authority, 
        elicits very little information, and allows agents to arrive, leave, and change their preferences over time.

      abstract: >
        A judgement aggregation rule takes the views of a collection of voters over a set of interconnected issues and yields a logically consistent 
        collective view. The median rule is a judgement aggregation rule that selects the logically consistent view which minimizes the average distance 
        to the views of the voters (where the "distance" between two views is the number of issues on which they disagree). In the special case of 
        preference aggregation, this is called the Kemeny rule. We show that, under appropriate regularity conditions, the median rule is the unique
        judgement aggregation rule which satisfies three axioms: Ensemble Supermajority Efficiency, Reinforcement, and Continuity. Our analysis covers 
        aggregation problems in which the consistency restrictions on input and output judgements may differ. We also allow for issues to be weighted, 
        and provide numerous examples in which issue weights arise naturally. The generalization to the weighted case requires non-trivial combinatorial
        conditions on the structure of the input and output spaces.

        In this talk, I will discuss a generalization of the classical stable matching problem that allows for cardinal preferences (as opposed to ordinal) 
        and fractional matchings (as opposed to integral). In this cardinal setting, stable fractional matchings can have much higher social welfare than
        their integral counterparts. This motivates the natural question of understanding the computational complexity of finding an optimal (i.e., 
        welfare-maximizing) stable fractional matching. I will present simple approximation algorithms for this problem with weak welfare guarantees and
        show that, somewhat surprisingly, achieving better approximations is computationally hard. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first 
        computational complexity results for stable fractional matchings. I will also discuss some structural observations as well as directions for 
        future research.

        over after the seeding. In multi-agent systems, how should agents spend their budgets to seed the network to maximize their utility in anticipation
        of other advertising agents and the network dynamics? In this talk, we will discuss our recent polynomial-time, scalable algorithm for equilibrium 
        computation in multi-agent influence games on networks, extending work of Bindel, Kleinberg, and Oren (2015) from the single-agent to the multi-agent 
        setting. Specifically, we showed that Nash equilibria of this game are pure and (under weak assumptions) unique, and can be computed in polynomial 
        time. We will also discuss a preliminary test of our model in the two-agent case on random graphs, where equilibria can be computed using mirror 
        descent.

        Pure strategy Nash equilibria (PSNE) almost never exist in spatial majority voting games when the number of positional dimensions is at least two.
        This is a persisting foundational issue with the spatial model.  However, positive results are possible when we add a valence parameter to the model.
        For example, it is known that an equilibrium exists in a majority voting game if and only if the radius of the yolk, a classic concept in the spatial 
        theory, is less than the square root of the valence parameter.  We prove a general theorem that enables us to characterize the set of all PSNE 
        for every spatial voting game with valence.  We complement this by establishing an equilibrium existence theorem based on a new concept, the b-yolk.

        Aggregating the preferences of individuals into a collective decision is the core subject of study of social choice theory. In 2006, Procaccia and 
        Rosenschein considered a utilitarian social choice setting, where the agents have explicit numerical values for the alternatives, yet they only report 
        their linear orderings over them. To compare different aggregation mechanisms, Procaccia and Rosenschein introduced the notion of distortion, which 
        quantifies the inefficiency of using only ordinal information when trying to maximize the social welfare, i.e., the sum of the underlying values of the 
        agents for the chosen outcome. Since then, this research area has flourished and bounds on the distortion have been obtained for a wide variety of 
        fundamental scenarios. However, the vast majority of the existing literature is focused on the case where nothing is known beyond the ordinal preferences
        of the agents over the alternatives.  We take a more expressive approach, and consider mechanisms that are allowed to further ask a few cardinal queries 
        in order to gain partial access to the underlying values that the agents have for the alternatives. With this extra power, we design new deterministic 
        mechanisms that achieve significantly improved distortion bounds and, in many cases, outperform the best-known randomized ordinal mechanisms. We conside
        r both the setting of general social choice and one-sided matching, and provide bounds on the possible tradeoffs between the distortion and the amount of 
        information elicited.

      abstract: >
        A key goal in judgment aggregation theory has always been to make collective judgments rational. So far, rationality has been understood in purely
        static terms: as coherence of judgments at a given time, where 'coherence' could for instance mean consistency, or completeness, or deductive closure,
        or combinations thereof. By contrast, this paper studies whether and how collective judgments can be dynamically rational, so that they respond well 
        to new information, i.e., change rationally when information is learnt by everyone. Formally, we call a judgment aggregation rule dynamically rational
        with respect to a given revision operator if, whenever all individuals revise their judgments in light of some information (a proposition), then the
        new aggregate judgments are the old ones revised in light of this information. In short, aggregation and revision commute. We establish a general 
        impossibility theorem: as long as the propositions on the agenda are sufficiently interconnected, no judgment aggregation rule with standard properties 
        is dynamically rational with respect to any revision operator satisfying mild conditions (familiar from belief revision theory). The theorem is a 
        counterpart for dynamic rationality of known impossibility theorems for static rationality. Turning to possibilities, the paper then makes a first 
        attempt to restore dynamic rationality, by showing that certain rules ('hierarchy rules') generate dynamic rationality with respect to special 
        ('hierarchical') revision operators. Like the familiar 'priority rules', such rules are guided by priorities between the propositions.

        relations. The first relation is used to make a shortlist of the feasible alternatives before the second is used to make a final choice. Rules in this
        class are characterized by four properties: two classical rationality requirements (Sen's expansion consistency and Manzini and Mariotti's weak WARP);
        and adaptations of two natural collective choice conditions (Arrow's independence of irrelevant alternatives and Saari and Barney's no preference 
        reversal bias). These rules also satisfy a number of other desirable properties, including a version of May's positive responsiveness.

        Participatory budgeting systems allow city residents to jointly decide on projects they wish to fund using public money, by letting residents vote on
        such projects. While participatory budgeting is gaining popularity, existing aggregation methods do not take into account the natural possibility of 
        project interactions, such as substitution and complementarity effects. Here we take a step towards fixing this issue by augmenting the standard model
        of participatory budgeting with a partition over the projects where we model the type and extent of project interactions within each part using certain 
        functions. We study the computational complexity of finding bundles that maximize voter utility, as defined with respect to such functions. Motivated by
        the desire to incorporate project interactions in real-world participatory budgeting systems, we identify certain cases that admit efficient aggregation 
        in the presence of such project interactions.

      abstract: >
        Axiomatic approaches are an appealing method for designing fair allocation algorithms, as they provide a formal structure for reasoning about and 
        rationalizing individual decisions. However, to make these algorithms useful in practice, their axioms must appropriately capture social norms. We 
        explore this tension between fairness axioms and socially acceptable decisions in the context of cooperative game theory for the fair division of 
        rewards.  We use two crowdsourced experiments to study people’s impartial reward divisions in cooperative games, focusing on games that systematically 
        vary the values of the single-player coalitions. Our results show that people select rewards that are remarkably consistent, but place much more 
        emphasis on the single-player coalitions than the Shapley value does. Further, their reward divisions violate both the null player and additivity
        axioms but support weaker axioms. We argue for a more general methodology of testing axioms against experimental data, retaining some of the conceptual 
        simplicity of the axiomatic approach while still using people’s opinions to drive the design of algorithms.

        We analyse the rationality of a Decision Maker (DM) who chooses from lists of sets of alternatives. A new class of choice functions, representing 
        DM's choice behaviour, and a novel rationality axiom named No-Regret (NR) are introduced. We show that the NR property, which suggests ignoring 
        alternatives disregarded in a previous choice procedure, is related to the famous rationality axioms Outcast, Heritage and Path-independence. Such 
        relationships depend on implementations of choice functions on lists of sets by means of the standard choice function on alternatives. We point out
        that No-Regret is a rationality criterion that encompasses these compelling properties of the classical choice model and extends them to the more 
        general framework of choice from lists of sets of alternatives.

        Distortion measures the inefficiency of using only ordinal information when attempting to select an optimal outcome, instead of the unknown
        numerical information. For example, in social choice applications, agents may have numerical costs for each of the possible alternatives, but the 
        mechanism must decide on a good alternative based only on the ordinal preferences of the agents which are induced by the underlying costs. In this
        talk, I will address bounding distortion under metric preferences, i.e., under the assumption that the agent costs form a metric space and thus obey 
        the triangle inequality. I will specifically focus on how a small amount of additional information about agent preferences can greatly reduce 
        distortion, and the resulting information-distortion tradeoffs.

      abstract: >
        We consider the setting of asynchronous opinion diffusion with majority threshold: given a social network with each agent assigned to one opinion,
        an agent will update its opinion if the majority of its neighbors agree on a different opinion. The stabilized final outcome highly depends on the 
        sequence in which agents update their opinion. We are interested in optimistic sequences−sequences that maximize the spread of a chosen opinion. We 
        complement known results for two opinions where optimistic sequences can be computed in time and length linear in the number of agents. We analyze
        upper and lower bounds on the length of optimistic sequences, showing quadratic bounds in the general and linear bounds in the acyclic case. Moreover,
        we show that in networks with more than two opinions determining a spread-maximizing sequence becomes intractable; surprisingly, already with 
        three opinions the intractability results hold in highly restricted cases, e.g., when each agent has at most three neighbors, when looking for
        a short sequence, or when we aim for approximate solutions.

        In the n-person bargaining model, the familiar Mid-point Domination property guarantees my worst utility if I have a 1/n-th chance of dictating

        utility at the arithmetic average of all outcomes. Maintaining equal treatment of agents and outcomes, and vNM utilities, the set of such Guarantees
        is of infinite dimension even with two agents and three outcomes. The natural subset of rank-additive Guarantees is of finite dimension, and in
        two-agent problems it boils down to the convex combinations of the veto Guarantees above. But more complicated options are  feasible among three
        or more agents.

        We study the potential for voter coordination in large elections. Drawing on equilibrium analysis and numerical simulations, we compare the three
        most basic rules for 3-candidate elections, under which voters may vote for exactly one candidate (Plurality Voting), for exactly two candidates 
        (Anti-Plurality) or for one or two candidates (Approval Voting). As well-known since Duverger (1951), Plurality Voting allows for voter coordination,
        but the election is indeterminate: at least two candidates are plausible winners. By contrast, coordination always fails under Anti-Plurality Voting.
        We further show that Approval voting always permits coordination when a Condorcet winner exists, and also ensures that, in most cases, only this 
        normatively appealing candidate can be elected. At the heart of our numerical results lies a novel algorithm computing voter best replies in a large
        election.

      abstract: >
        We consider a fair division problem, with n agents and a set Ω to divide. An individual "guarantee" is a utility level which an agent is regarded as 
        entitled to. It only depends on her preferences and exogenous rights, and on physical constraints of the division problem: the set Ω and the number 
        n of participants (but it should not depend on preferences or other characteristics of other agents). For example, if Ω is a finite set of divisible
        goods and preferences are non-negative convex, a compelling symmetric and feasible guarantee is individual's utility of (1/n)Ω. If  Ω is arbitrary 
        but preferences are additive non-negative, it would be (1/n)-th of the individual's utility of the whole Ω. We consider a general case, when utilities
        are continuous, but neither convex nor monotonic, or even positive. In a "cake-cutting" problem, we can always guarantee each agent her minmax utility: 
        that of her best share in the worst possible partition. It is lower than her maxmin utility (that of her worst share in the best possible partition),
        that cannot always be guaranteed to all agents (even for n=2). Moreover, a little-known generalization of the Divide and Choose algorithm to any number 
        n of agents implements this guarantee with a simple sequence of cuts and queries. These findings rely on the equi-partition lemma, which shows that,
        for any n and any continuous utility u on a bounded measurable Ω in Euclidean space, one can always find a partition of Ω in n elements with 
        identical utility. This is a highly non-trivial mathematical result, proven in a companion paper by R. Karasev and S. Avvakumov.

      abstract: >
        Hedonic games are coalition formation games where players have preferences over the coalitions they may join. Considering not only the players'
        own (friend-oriented) preferences but also their friends’ preferences in such games, Nguyen et al. (AAMAS'16) introduced and studied three degrees
        of altruistic hedonic games based on selfish-first, equal-treatment, and altruistic-treatment preferences, which depend on the order in which players
        look at their own or their friends’ preferences. In this talk, a related approach due to Wiechers and Rothe (STAIRS'20) will be presented: By 
        replacing the average by the minimum in their definitions, we introduce the corresponding minimum-based variants of the same three degrees of 
        altruism. As innocent as this definitional change appears, it is as fundamental as switching from utilitarian to egalitarian social welfare. We
        study this novel concept of altruism in hedonic games in terms of the common notions of stability in such games, and the related decision 
        problems in terms of their computational complexity.  We also briefly mention an extension, due to Kerkmann and Rothe (IJCAI'20), of the model
        of altruism in hedonic games to coalition formation games in general.

      abstract: >
        We develop a framework to leverage the smoothed complexity analysis by Spielman and Teng (2004) to circumvent paradoxes and impossibility theorems 
        in social choice, motivated by the low-stakes, large-scale, and frequently-used modern applications of social choice powered by AI and ML. For 
        Condorcet's paradox, we prove that the smoothed likelihood of the paradox either vanishes at an exponential rate as the number of agents increases,
        or does not vanish at all. For the folklore impossibility theorem on the non-existence of voting rules that simultaneously satisfy anonymity and
        neutrality, we characterize the rate for the impossibility to vanish, to be either polynomially fast or exponentially fast. We also propose a
        novel easy-to-compute tie-breaking mechanism that optimally preserves anonymity and neutrality for even number of alternatives in natural settings.
        Our results illustrate the smoothed possibility of social choice—even though the paradox and the impossibility theorem hold in the worst case, 
        they may not be a big concern in practice. The main technical tool we developed is a dichotomous characterization of the smoothed likelihood for
        a Poisson multinomial variable to satisfy a system of linear inequalities, which might be of independent interest and can be used to study 
        various other events in social choice, such as the likelihood of tied elections, likelihood of (weak) Condorcet winner(s) and Condorcet cycles, etc.

      abstract: >
        We study voting rules for participatory budgeting, where a group of voters
        collectively decides which projects should be funded using a common budget.
        We allow the projects to have arbitrary costs, and the voters to have
        arbitrary additive valuations over the projects. We formulate two axioms
        that guarantee proportional representation to groups of voters with common
        interests. To the best of our knowledge, all known rules for participatory
        budgeting do not satisfy either of the two axioms; in addition, we show
        that the most prominent proportional rules for committee elections (such as
        Proportional Approval Voting) cannot be adapted to arbitrary costs nor to
        additive valuations so that they would satisfy our axioms of proportionality.
        We construct a simple and attractive voting rule that satisfies one of our
        axioms (for arbitrary costs and arbitrary additive valuations), and that can
        be evaluated in polynomial time. We prove that our other stronger axiom is
        also satisfiable, though by a computationally more expensive and less natural
        voting rule.

        Facility location is a fundamental problem in social choice with a number of practical application. In this talk, 
        I study the impact on extending mechanisms for locating facilities on the line to mechanisms for locating facilities 
        in Euclidean or Manhattan space. I consider three fundamental axiomatic properties: anonymity, which is a simple 
        fairness property; Pareto optimality, which is one of the most fundamental efficiency properties; and strategy-proofness,
        which ensures agents have no incentive to mis-report their location. I also consider how well strategy-proof mechanisms
        can approximate the optimal welfare.

      abstract: >
        Label ranking is a machine learning problem that is concerned with predicting the order of a set of labels for an
        object.  Examples include: (a) predicting a ranked list of preferences for a given person, (b) providing an ordered
        list of the most suitable advertisements for a given Facebook profile, and even (c) predicting the most drug-resistant
        mutations in a genome. Ensemble models are a common machine learning technique that collects the results of multiple 
        simple models and combines them into a single aggregated output, thus enhancing performance. We propose to apply 
        voting rules as the aggregation technique for label ranking ensembles. Furthermore, we propose a novel aggregation
        method for label ranking ensembles that learns the best voting rule to be used in each setting. An evaluation of
        the proposed method shows that it obtains prediction performance that is significantly higher than that of the 
        aggregation techniques currently used by state-of-the-art label ranking ensembles.

        url: https://web.stanford.edu/~jacksonm/
      abstract: >
        We examine how well people learn when information is noisily relayed from person to person; and we study how 
        communication platforms can improve learning without censoring or fact-checking messages. We analyze learning 
        as a function of social network depth (how many times information is relayed) and breadth (the number of relay
        chains accessed). Noise builds up as depth increases, so learning requires greater breadth. In the presence of
        mutations (deliberate or random) and transmission failures of messages, we characterize sharp thresholds for 
        breadths above which receivers learn fully and below which they learn nothing. When there is uncertainty about
        mutation rates, optimizing learning requires either capping depth, or if that is not possible, limiting breadth 
        by capping the number of people to whom someone can forward a message. Limiting breadth cuts the number of 
        messages received but also decreases the fraction originating further from the receiver, and so can increase the
        signal to noise ratio. Finally, we extend our model to study learning from message survival: e.g., people are
        more likely to pass messages with one conclusion than another. We find that as depth grows, all learning comes 
        from either the total number of messages received or from the content of received messages, but the learner 
        does not need to pay attention to both.

      abstract: >
        Finitely many agents have preferences on a finite set of alternatives, single-peaked with respect to a connected 
        graph with these alternatives as vertices. A probabilistic rule assigns to each preference profile a probability
        distribution over the alternatives. First, all unanimous and strategy-proof probabilistic rules are characterized 
        when the graph is a tree. These rules are uniquely determined by their outcomes at those preference profiles where
        all peaks are on leafs of the tree, and thus extend the known case of a line graph. Second, it is shown that 
        every unanimous and strategy-proof probabilistic rule is random-dictatorial if and only if the graph has no leafs.
        Finally, the two results are combined to obtain a general characterization for every connected graph by using
        its block tree representation.

        How should we aggregate the ex ante preferences of Bayesian agents with heterogeneous beliefs? Suppose the state 
        of the world is described by a random process that unfolds over time. Different agents have different beliefs 
        about the probabilistic laws governing this process. As new information is revealed over time by the process, 
        agents update their beliefs and preferences via Bayes rule. Consider a Pareto principle that applies only to 
        preferences which remain stable in the long run under these updates. I show that this "eventual Pareto" principle
        implies that the social planner must be a utilitarian. But it does not impose any relationship between the beliefs
        of the individuals and those of the planner.

      abstract: >
        The cake-cutting problem provides a model for addressing fair allocation of a divisible resource (metaphorically,
        the cake) among agents with distinct preferences. Classic results of Stromquist (1980) and Su (1999) show that 
        envy-free (fair) cake divisions are guaranteed to exist under mild conditions. These strong existential results 
        essentially follow from fixed-point theorems and stand without an algorithmic counterpart; Stromquist (2008) has
        shown that an envy-free cake division with contiguous pieces cannot be computed in bounded time. In this talk I 
        will present a result which complements these existential (and non-constructive) guarantees by way of developing
        efficient cake-cutting algorithms for a broad class of valuations. In particular, our algorithmic result holds
        when the agents' valuations are induced by linear translations of any log-concave function, such as Gaussian, 
        exponential, linear, or binomial.

      abstract: >
        Secret sharing is a cryptographic implementation of a power-sharing agreement in society. At the centre of it is 
        'the secret', which is a string of 0 and 1 by knowing which a certain activity can be launched: accessing a
        bitcoin wallet; launching a nuclear warhead; signing a message on behalf of a large organisation, e.g., Adobe. 
        The power structure is given by the set of authorised coalitions−coalitions who are authorised to launch the activity.
        We consider the digital forensics aspects of secret sharing.  Sometimes an investigation is needed to establish: 
        Who made this suspicious transaction with bitcoins? Who signed this offensive letter? Who opened a certain vault?
        We investigate the problem of framing, which occurs when a coalition is able to calculate the share of a participant
        who does not belong to it.  In the extreme case one authorised coalition can calculate shares of another authorised
        coalition and use the secret  in some way blaming another authorised coalition for their action. We show that in
        any efficient and secure secret-sharing scheme framing is unavoidable.

        url: https://sites.google.com/site/harisaziz/
      abstract: >
        We consider the problem of probabilistic allocation of objects under ordinal preferences. Our main contribution
        is an allocation mechanism, called the vigilant eating rule (VER), that applies to nearly arbitrary distributional
        constraints. It is constrained ordinally-efficient, can be computed efficiently for a large class of constraints,
        and treats agents equally if they have the same preferences and are subject to the same constraints. When the set
        of feasible allocations is convex, we also present a characterization of our rule based on ordinal egalitarianism.
        Our general results concerning VER do not just apply to allocation problems but to any collective choice problem
        in which agents have ordinal preferences over discrete outcomes. As a case study, we assume objects have priorities 
        for agents and apply VER to sets of probabilistic allocations that are constrained by stability. VER coincides 
        with the (extended) probabilistic serial rule when priorities are flat and the agent-proposing deterministic 
        deferred acceptance algorithm when preferences and priorities are strict. While VER always returns a stable and 
        constrained efficient allocation, it fails to be strategyproof, unconstrained efficient, and envy-free. We show, 
        however, that each of these three properties is incompatible with stability and constrained efficiency.

        We propose a market-inspired bidding scheme for the assignment of paper reviews in large academic conferences.
        The primary contribution is an analysis of the incentives of reviewers during the bidding phases, when reviewers
        have private costs and some information about the demand for each paper, and want to obtain the best possible k
        papers for a predetermined k. We show that by assigning budgets to reviewers and a 'price' for every paper that 
        is (roughly) inversely proportional to its  demand, the best response of a reviewer is to bid sincerely, i.e.,
        on her most favorite papers, and match the budget even when it is not enforced.  Finally, we show via extensive 
        simulations on bidding data from real conferences, that our suggested bidding scheme would substantially improve
        the assignment, under several common assignment algorithms.

        url: https://www.bklaus.net/
      abstract: >
        We  propose a variant of the housing market model à la Shapley and Scarf (1974) that incorporates a limited form
        of externality in consumption; that is, agents care both about their own consumption (selfish preferences) and
        about the agent who receives their endowment (altruistic preferences). First, we consider different domains of 
        preference relations by taking selfish and altruistic aspects of preferences into account (separable preferences,
        additive separable preferences, and selfish and/or altruistic lexicographic preferences) and several results 
        regarding the core for such housing markets are collected. Second, if preferences are either selfish lexicographic
        or altruistic lexicographic, we characterize the corresponding top trading cycles rule by individual rationality,
        Pareto optimality, and strategy-proofness. Since on the lexicographic preference domains the core can be multi-valued,
        our characterization sheds light on the fact that the properties that also characterized the strict core rule for 
        Shapley-Scarf housing markets (Ma, 1994) characterize the top trading cycles rule and not the strict core rule
        (or correspondence).

        Spatial models in voting have received a lot of attention in recent years, both in the physical sense (e.g., 
        gerrymandering) as well as the conceptual sense (e.g., distortion). We will show two separate threads of spatial
        problems, which have received less attention recently. One deals with the well-known Hotelling-Downs model, adapted
        to the more common (in COMSOC literature) winner-take-all setting. We characterize Nash equilibria for multiple 
        voting rules, and try to measure the "amount" of equilibria, by measuring the probability of randomly reaching a
        NE. The second deals with the problem of placing voting locations, in which we show many settings of the problem 
        are difficult even to approximate (but a few are not!). Both problems present a rich set of questions which
        require further exploration.

        Solution concepts in collective decision making are usually defined assuming complete knowledge of individuals'
        preferences and of the mechanism used for aggregating them. This is often impractical or unrealistic. Under 
        incomplete knowledge, a solution advocated by many consists in  quantifying over all completions of the incomplete 
        preference profile (or all instantiations of the incompletely specified mechanism). Voting rules can be 'modalized'
        this way (leading to the notions of possible and necessary winners), and also efficiency and fairness notions in 
        fair division, stability concepts in coalition formation, and more. The talk will give a very brief survey of works
        along this line, focusing on examples.

        In social choice theory, we routinely attempt to justify the use of a given voting rule on axiomatic grounds. 
        In this talk, I instead want to ask the question of what it might mean to directly justify an election outcome
        on axiomatic grounds. A possible answer, I will argue, is that a justification has two parts: a set of normative 
        principles (meaning, axioms) and a step-by-step explanation of how those principles force us to choose the outcome
        in question for a given profile of preferences. I will also discuss recent work on the use of tools from the 
        field of automated reasoning to compute such justifications.

    This June many of us were hoping to travel to Mexico for the 15th Meeting of the Society for Social Choice and 
    Welfare. To mark this occasion we are organising two special sessions with speakers from Mexico as well as some 
    of the original keynote speakers. This is the second of these sessions.
  presentations:
    - title: "Who Cares More: Allocation with Diverse Preference Intensities"
      speaker:
        name: "Leeat Yariv"
        affiliation: "Princeton"
        url: https://www.lyariv.com/
      abstract: >
        Goods and services—public housing, medical appointments, schools—are often allocated to individuals who rank 
        them similarly but differ in their preference intensities. We characterize optimal allocation rules in such 
        settings, considering both the case in which individual preferences are known and ones in which they need to 
        be elicited. Several insights emerge. First-best allocations may involve allocating to some agents lotteries 
        between very high-ranked and very low-ranked goods. When preference intensities are private information, 
        second-best allocations always involve such lotteries and, crucially, may coincide with first-best allocations.
        Second-best allocations may also entail disposal of services. We also discuss market-based alternative approach
        and show how it differs.

    - title: "Time-Consistent Rational Inattention is Entropic"
      speaker:
        name: "Tetsuya Hoshino"
        affiliation: "ITAM"
        url: https://sites.google.com/view/tetsuyahoshino
      abstract: >
        We study a dynamic rational inattention problem in which, each period, an agent acquires costly information 
        about an evolving state and chooses an action. A dynamic rational inattention problem is time-consistent if its 
        value function satisfies the dynamic programming principle. The main result is that if every dynamic rational
        inattention problem is time-consistent then the cost function is entropic—that is, linear in the reduction in
        entropy of beliefs. This result corresponds to the converse to Steiner, Stewart, and Matějka (2017), who showed 
        that every dynamic rational inattention problem with entropy costs is time-consistent.

      speaker:
        name: "Roman Pancs"
        affiliation: "ITAM"
        url: https://sites.google.com/site/romanspancs/
      abstract: >
        We introduce the framework to examine, both theoretically and empirically, (geographic) electoral maldistricting.
        Maldistricting is defined as electoral districting in pursuit of a policy or incumbency objective at the expense 
        of social welfare. Thanks to a revelation principle-like property of our environment, analysis is performed on 
        the set of implementable (via some districting) legislatures. Implementable legislatures are characterized multiply,
        including in terms of their informativeness about voter ideology. Maldistricting is quantified by an observed 
        legislature’s distance from welfare-maximizing legislatures relative to the maldistricted ones.  If voter turnout
        can vary across geographic locations, electoral districting becomes more delicate.

    - title: "All Sequential Allotment Rules are Obviously Strategy-proof"
      speaker:
        name: "Jordi Massó"
        affiliation: "Barcelona"
        url: https://sites.google.com/view/jordi-masso/home
      abstract: >
        For the division problem with single-peaked preferences (Sprumont, 1991) we show that all sequential allotment
        rules, identified by Barberà, Jackson and Neme (1997) as the class of strategy-proof, efficient and 
        replacement-monotonic rules, are also obviously strategy-proof. Although obvious strategy-proofness is in 
        general more restrictive than strategy-proofness, this is not the case in this setting.

    - title: "Resolving the Optimal Metric Distortion Conjecture"
      speaker:
        name: "Nisarg Shah"
        affiliation: "Toronto"
        url: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~nisarg/
      abstract: >
        In the metric distortion framework of voting, voters and candidates lie in a metric space, and each voter ranks 
        the candidates by their distance from her. The voting rule takes only the preference rankings as input, and
        picks a candidate that approximately minimizes the total distance from the voters. The distortion of a rule is
        its worst-case approximation ratio. A major conjecture in this framework is that the optimal deterministic
        voting rule has distortion 3. We resolve this conjecture positively by constructing a new voting rule that 
        has distortion 3. We do so by proving a novel lemma about matching rankings of candidates to candidates, which
        may be of independent interest. We also provide parametric distortion bounds and improved bounds for randomized
        rules.

    - title: "Fairness in Kidney Exchange Programmes"
      speaker:
        name: "Péter Biró"
        affiliation: "Budapest"
        url: https://mechanismdesign.eu/biro/
      abstract: >
        Most of the large European countries are operating national kidney exchange programmes (KEPs) with various 
        policies and performances. The primal objective is always to maximise the number of transplants, but increased
        attention is being paid to the quality of transplants as well, especially when compatible or ABO-incompatible
        pairs are incentivised to join these programmes instead of conducting a direct transplant. We argue that the 
        concept of stability can play an important role in future applications due to individual fairness and incentive 
        considerations. Furthermore, fairness concepts can also become crucial at country level when multiple countries 
        are joining their pools. In this talk we will review the recent developments on the aspects of individual and 
        collective fairness for KEPs from both theoretical and practical point of views, starting with a story from the
        2008 COMSOC conference.

    - title: "Resolution Rules in a System of Financially Linked Firms"
      speaker:
        name: "Gabrielle Demange"
        affiliation: "Paris"
        url: https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/demange-gabrielle/
      abstract: >
        The reimbursement abilities of firms holding liabilities on each other are intertwined, potentially generating 
        coordination failures and defaults through uncontrolled contagion. In stress episodes, these linkages thus call 
        for an orderly resolution, as implemented by a regulatory authority assigning the amount each firm within the 
        system reimburses to each other one. The paper studies such resolution by considering 'rules', assuming their 
        primary goal is to avoid default on external debts, say, banks' defaults on deposits. The main objective is to
        investigate what proportionality means for a rule, taking into account various legal and informational 
        constraints.

    - title: "A Learning Framework for Distribution-Based Game-Theoretic Solution Concepts"
      speaker:
        name: "Yair Zick"
        affiliation: "Singapore"
        url: https://people.cs.umass.edu/~yzick/
      abstract: >
        The past few years have seen several works on learning economic solutions from data; these include optimal 
        auction design, function optimization, stable payoffs in cooperative games and more. In this work, we provide
        a unified learning-theoretic methodology for modeling such problems, and establish tools for determining whether
        a given economic solution concept can be learned from data. Our learning theoretic framework generalizes a 
        notion of function space dimension -- the graph dimension -- adapting it to the solution concept learning domain.
        We identify sufficient conditions for the PAC learnability of solution concepts, and show that results in
        existing works can be immediately derived using our methodology. Finally, we apply our methods in other 
        economic domains, yielding a novel notion of PAC competitive equilibrium and PAC Condorcet winners.

    - title: "Game-Theoretic Analysis for Two-Sided Matching with Resource Allocation"
      speaker:
        name: "Makoto Yokoo "
        affiliation: "Kyushu University"
        url: https://sites.google.com/view/makoto-yokoo/
      abstract: >
        In this work, we consider a student-project-resource matching-allocation problem, where students have
        preferences over projects and the projects have preferences over students. Although students are many-to-one
        matched to projects, indivisible resources are many-to-one allocated to projects whose capacities are 
        endogenously determined by the resources allocated to them. Traditionally, this problem is decomposed into two 
        separate problems: (1) resources are allocated to projects based on expectations (resource allocation problem),
        and (2) students are matched to projects based on the capacities determined in the previous problem (matching
        problem).  Although both problems are well-understood, if the expectations used in the first are incorrect, we
        obtain a suboptimal outcome. Thus, this problem must be solved as a whole without dividing it in two parts.  We
        show that no strategyproof mechanism satisfies fairness (i.e., no student has justified envy) and weak 
        efficiency requirements on students' welfare. Given this impossibility result, we develop a new strategyproof
        mechanism that strikes a good balance between fairness and efficiency and assess it by experiments.

    - title: "Fair Division of Mixed Divisible and Indivisible Goods"
      speaker:
        name: "Xiaohui Bei"
        affiliation: "Nanyang Technological University"
        url: https://people.cs.umass.edu/~yzick/
      abstract: >
        In this talk, we will discuss the challenges of defining fairness and designing fair division algorithms when
        the resources to be allocated contain both divisible and indivisible goods. Classic fairness notions such as 
        envy-freeness (EF) and envy-freeness up to one good (EF1) cannot be directly applied to the mixed goods setting.
        We propose a new fairness notion envy-freeness for mixed goods (EFM), which is a direct generalization of
        both EF and EF1 to the mixed goods setting. We show that an EFM allocation always exists for any number of
        agents and discuss how to find an ε-EFM allocation in polynomial time in the Robertson-Webb model.

      abstract: >
        Popularity is an optimality notion that connects the Condorcet criterion known from voting with stability known
        from matchings under preferences. The popular roommates problem is defined on a non-bipartite graph, where each
        vertex submits a strictly ordered preference list of its neighbors. A matching M is popular if there is no 
        matching N such that vertices that prefer N to M outnumber those that prefer M to N. The complexity of finding
        a popular matching had been open for a long time before its solution last year. In this talk, we review recent 
        progress on complexity, approximation, and algorithms for this problem.

      speaker:
        name: "Remzi Sanver"
        affiliation: "Paris"
        url: https://sanver.bilgi.edu.tr/
      abstract: >
        We propose strike mechanisms as a solution to the classical problem of Hurwicz and Schmeidler (1978) and Maskin 
        (1999) according to which, in two-person societies, no Pareto efficient rule is Nash-implementable. A strike 
        mechanism specifies the number of alternatives that each player vetoes. Each player simultaneously casts these
        vetoes and the mechanism selects randomly one alternative among the unvetoed ones. For strict preferences over
        alternatives and under a very weak condition for extending preferences over lotteries, these mechanisms are
        deterministic-in-equilibrium. They Nash-implement a class of Pareto efficient social choice rules called 
        Pareto-and-veto rules. Moreover, under mild richness conditions on the domain of preferences over lotteries, 
        any Pareto efficient Nash-implementable rule is a Pareto-and-veto rule and hence is implementable through a 
        strike mechanism.

        We consider the problem of forming a testbed of elections to be used for various election-related experiments 
        (such as testing algorithms or estimating the frequency of a given phenomenon). We seek elections that come 
        from well-known statistical distributions and are as diverse as possible. To this end, we define a (pseudo)metric
        over elections, generate a large set of election instances, and measure distances between them, to assess how
        diverse they are. We argue that our metric is a reasonable choice, and we show how the resulting set of 
        elections can be used to evaluate election-related algorithms.

        name: "Clemens Puppe"
        affiliation: "Karlsruhe"
        url: https://micro.econ.kit.edu/english/puppe.php
      abstract: >
        We study a model in which agents with single-peaked preferences can participate in a costly voting procedure
        to determine the value of a one-dimensional variable. We show that, for all positive participation cost and
        all profiles of individual preferences, there exists a generically unique equilibrium with one single 
        participant whenever the voting mechanism is strategy-proof, anonymous, and responsive in the sense that the
        outcome reacts to a unanimous move of the votes of all agents in the same direction. Since this single 
        participant is never the median voter, we obtain as a corollary that no deterministic mechanism can implement 
        the median if all participants vote according to their unique dominant strategy; even worse, the peak of 
        the single participant in equilibrium is maximally far away from the median voter. By contrast, there are 
        simple probabilistic strategy-proof mechanisms that yield the median as outcome. Inspired by this observation,
        we investigate if the median can be ‘approximately implemented’ by a natural deterministic counterpart, and
        come to a negative conclusion.

        Many algorithms in AI require an objective function to be specified.  When such an algorithm is to be deployed
        in the real world, it is often not obvious what the objective function should be.  For example, there are often
        nontrivial ethical tradeoffs.  Generally, stakeholders will disagree on how these should be made.  Moreover, 
        even for themselves, they will generally not be able to write down a complete objective function; perhaps at 
        most, they can be asked to make a few judgments on some concrete examples.  How do we aggregate these individual
        judgments into an objective function for the algorithm to use?

        We examine the problem of assigning plots of land to prospective buyers who prefer living next to their friends.
        They care not only about the plot they receive, but also about their neighbors. This externality results in a
        highly non-trivial problem structure, as both friendship and land value play a role in determining agent behavior.
        We examine mechanisms that guarantee truthful reporting of both land values and friendships. We propose variants 
        of random serial dictatorship (RSD) that can offer both truthfulness and welfare guarantees. Interestingly, our
        social welfare guarantees are parameterized by the value of friendship: if these values are low, enforcing truthful
        behavior results in poor welfare guarantees and imposes significant constraints on agents' choices; if they are 
        high, we achieve good approximation to the optimal social welfare.
