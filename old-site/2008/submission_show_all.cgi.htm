Since goods are available in integer units only, the social choice theory for such problems cannot exploit any smoothness property, which may otherwise have been embedded in the preferences of the agents. This makes the outcome function approach for the study of such problems quite compelling. Our purpose here is to study outcome functions, which are efficient and consistent. We provide an example to show that the competitive social choice function may not be converse consistent. The competitive outcome function is easily observed to be efficient, consistent and converse consistent. What we are able to show here is that any efficient and consistent outcome function which is “reasonably well-behaved” for two-agent problems, must be a sub-correspondence of the competitive outcome function. Our proof of this result requires the converse consistency of the competitive outcome function.</div></a></td></tr> <tr><td><a name="3">3: Pierre Lescanne. <span class="title">(Mechanical) Reasoning on Infinite Extensive&nbsp;&nbsp;Games</span>  &nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="submission_download.cgi?c=.7065;submission=104263">submission</a>  &nbsp; <a href="submission_info_show.cgi?c=.7065;number=104263">information</a>

In this paper, the complexity of comparison of influence between players in coalitional voting games is characterized. The possible representations of simple games considered are simple games represented by winning coalitions, minimal winning coalitions, weighted voting game or a multiple weighted voting game. The influence of players is gauged from the viewpoint of basic player types, desirability relations and classical power indices such as Shapley-Shubik index, Banzhaf index, Holler index, Deegan-Packel index and Chow parameters. Among other results, it is shown that for a simple game represented by minimal winning coalitions, although it is easy to verify whether a player has zero or one voting power, computing the Banzhaf value of the player is $\#$P-complete. Moreover, it is proved that multiple weighted voting games are the only representations for which it is NP-hard to verify whether the game is linear or not. For a simple game with a set $W^m$ of minimal winning coalitions and $n$ players, a $O(n.|W^m|+n^2log(n))$ algorithm is presented which returns no if the game is non-linear and returns the strict desirability ordering otherwise. The complexity of transforming simple games into compact representations is also examined.</div></a></td></tr> <tr><td><a name="6">6: Mostapha DISS, Ahmed LOUICHI, Vincent MERLIN and Hatem SMAOUI. <span class="title">On the stability of a scoring rules set under the IAC hypothesis</span>  &nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="submission_download.cgi?c=.7065;submission=105970">submission</a>  &nbsp; <a href="submission_info_show.cgi?c=.7065;number=105970">information</a>

In such situations consequentialism property allows us to induce voters' preferences on voting rules from preferences over alternatives. A voting rule employed to resolve the society’s choice problem is self-selective if it chooses itself when it is also used in choosing the voting rule. A menu of voting rules is said to be stable if it contains at least one self-selective voting rule at each profile of preferences on voting rules. We consider in this paper a society which will make choice among a menu constituted by three alternatives {a, b, c} and a set of the three well-known scoring voting rules {Borda, Plurality, Antiplurality}. Under the Impartial Anonymous Culture Assumption (IAC), we will derive a probability for the stability of this triplet of voting rules. For mathematical tools, we use Ehrhart polynomials in order to solve our problems. This method counts the number of lattice points inside a convex bounded polyhedron (polytope). We discuss briefly recent algorithmic solutions to this method and conclude with a look at what happens when trying to solve our problems.</div></a></td></tr> <tr><td><a name="7">7: Jose Apesteguia and Miguel A.

We dub such mechanisms manipulation optimal. We prove&nbsp;&nbsp;that any manipulation-optimal mechanism can have at most one manipulable type&nbsp;&nbsp;per agent. We show the existence of manipulation-optimal multiagent mechanisms&nbsp;&nbsp;with the goal of social welfare maximization, but not in dominant strategies when&nbsp;&nbsp;agents are anonymous and the mechanism is symmetric, the most common setting.

However, when clearing the auction, the use of an utilitarian view can cause some problems, such as bidders dropping out of the market. To avoid that, we have introduced a priority mechanism to add fairness to the coordination process, so that the access to the resources is evenly distributed among all the agents. We have applied the proposed coordination mechanism to a waste water treatment system scenario, where different industries need to discharge their waste, according to its manufacturing plan.

A common approach is to assume that the preferences of the agents can be represented by \emph{quasilinear utility functions}. This restriction allows for the positive results of the Vickrey auction and the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism. Quasilinear preferences, however, involve the controversial assumption that there is some commonly desired commodity or numeraire---money, shells, beads, etcetera---the utility of which is commensurable with the utility of the other alternatives in question. We propose a generalization of the Vickrey auction, which does not assume the agents' preferences being quasilinear but still has some of its desirable properties. In this auction a bid can be any alternative, rather than just a monetary bid. Such an auction is also applicable to situations where no numeraire is available, when there is a fixed budget, or when money is no issue. In the presence of quasilinear preferences, however, the traditional Vickrey turns out to be a special case. In order to sidestep the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem, we restrict the preferences of the bidders.

We introduce two new expressiveness measures, 1) maximum impact dimension, which captures the number of ways that an agent can impact the outcome, and 2) shatterable outcome dimension, which is based on the concept of shattering from computational learning theory. We derive an upper bound on the expected efficiency of any mechanism under its most efficient Nash equilibrium. Remarkably, it depends only on the mechanism’s expressiveness. We prove that the bound increases strictly as we allow more expressiveness. We also show that in some cases a small increase in expressiveness yields an arbitrarily large increase in the bound.

Unfortunately, the problem is NP-hard. Extending our previous work (AAIM08),&nbsp;&nbsp;we show that the Kemeny score of an election can be computed efficiently whenever the average pairwise distance between two input votes is not too large. In other words, Kemeny Score is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the parameter ``average pairwise Kendall-Tau distance d_a''. We describe a fixed-parameter algorithm with running time O^*(4^d_a).</div></a></td></tr> <tr><td><a name="48">48: Szymon Klarman. <span class="title">Judgment Aggregation as Maximization of Epistemic and Social Utility</span>  &nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="submission_download.cgi?c=.7065;submission=107541">submission</a>  &nbsp; <a href="submission_info_show.cgi?c=.7065;number=107541">information</a>

We recall how the latter has been tackled by I. Levi in the decision-theoretic framework and consider the possibility of applying a similar approach to the judgment aggregation problem. Finally, we propose a method of aggregation built on the concepts of epistemic and social utility of accepting a collective judgment, which accounts for such parameters --- arguably of importance for aggregation tasks --- as the factual truth of the propositions, reliability of agents, information content (completeness) of possible collective judgments and the level of agreement between the agents. We claim that the expected utility of accepting a collective judgment depends on the degree to which all those objectives are satisfied and that groups of rational agents aim at maximizing it, while solving a judgment aggregation problems.</div></a></td></tr> <tr><td><a name="49">49: Rolf Haenni. <span class="title">Aggregating Referee Scores: an Algebraic Approach</span>  &nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="submission_download.cgi?c=.7065;submission=107543">submission</a>  &nbsp; <a href="submission_info_show.cgi?c=.7065;number=107543">information</a>

This model is intended to be used for solving Distributed Constraint Satisfaction Problem (DCSP) which is an emerged field from the integration between two paradigms of different nature: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) that is characterized by the autonomy and the distribution of its entities and the Constraint Satisfaction Problem paradigm (CSP) where all constraints are treated in central manner as a black-box. CACS is based on special kind of agents called Controllers. A controller role is to encapsulate and verify some constraints assigned to it. This model allows grouping constraints to form a subset that will be treated together as a local problem inside the controller. Using this model allows also handling non-binary constraints easily and directly so that no translating of constraints into binary ones is needed.<br/>Based on CACS, a prototype of DCSP solver is built. This paper presents the implementation outlines of that prototype and its usage methodology. The prototype is built in Java using general interfaces of both MAS and CSP platforms. These interfaces allow users to use the platforms of their choice providing that they implement these interfaces with the chosen platforms.</div></a></td></tr> <tr><td><a name="54">54: Daniel Eckert. <span class="title">Guilbaud's Theorem: An early contribution to computational social choice?</span>  &nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="submission_download.cgi?c=.7065;submission=107558">submission</a>  &nbsp; <a href="submission_info_show.cgi?c=.7065;number=107558">information</a>

In such control scenarios, an external agent seeks to change the outcome of an election via actions such as adding/deleting/partitioning either candidates or voters. SP-AV combines the voters' preference rankings with their approvals of candidates, and we adapt it here so as to keep its useful features with respect to approval strategies even in the presence of control actions. We prove that this system is computationally resistant (i.e., the corresponding control problems are NP-hard) to 19 out of 22 types of constructive and destructive control. Thus, SP-AV has more resistances to control, by three, than is currently known for any other natural voting system with a polynomial-time winner problem. In particular, SP-AV is (after Copeland voting, see Faliszewski et al.
