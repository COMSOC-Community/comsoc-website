<h2>AIMS AND SCOPE</h2>
<hr>

<p>
Computational social choice is  an interdisciplinary field of study at
the interface  of social  choice theory and  computer science.   It is
concerned  with the  application  of computational  techniques to  the
study of social choice mechanisms,  and with the integration of social
choice paradigms into computing. The aim of the COMSOC workshops is to
bring  together the  different communities  that have  been addressing
such issues: computer scientists interested in computational issues in
social   choice;  people  working   in  artificial   intelligence  and
multiagent systems  who are using  ideas from social choice  theory to
organise societies of artificial software agents; logicians interested
in  the logic-based  specification and  analysis of  social procedures
(social software);  and last but  not least people coming  from social
choice theory itself.
</p>

<p>
COMSOC-2008 is funded by an  EPSRC research grant, which will allow us
to  bring in  a number  of prominent  scientists as  invited speakers,
whilst keeping registration fees very low.
</p>

<hr>
<h2>INVITED SPEAKERS</h2>
<hr>

<p>
COMSOC-2008   will   feature  invited   talks   by  Salvador   Barbera
(Barcelona),  Rohit  Parikh   (CUNY),  Tuomas  Sandholm  (CMU),  Moshe
Tennenholtz (Technion), and William Thomson (Rochester).
</p>

<hr>
<h2>PAPER SUBMISSIONS</h2>
<hr>

<p>
Submissions of full papers describing original or  recently  published 
work on all aspects of computational social choice are invited. Topics
of interest include, but are not limited to:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> complexity-theoretic analysis of voting procedures </li>
 <li> computational aspects of fair division  </li>
 <li> cake-cutting algorithms </li>
 <li> distributed negotiation in multiagent system </li>
 <li> preference representation in combinatorial domains </li>
 <li> computational aspects of preference aggregation rules </li>
 <li> preference elicitation </li>
 <li> social choice and constraint programming </li>
 <li> social choice and the web: ranking systems </li>
 <li> belief and judgement aggregation </li>
 <li> computational aspects of coalition formation </li>
 <li> social choice under uncertainty </li>
 <li> logics for collective decision making </li>
 <li> logic-based verification of social procedures  </li>
 <li> communication complexity of social choice mechanisms </li>
 <li> computational issues in mechanism design </li>
</ul>

<p>
Paper submission  is electronic via  the workshop website
(submission deadline: 3rd June 2008).
Papers (of
around 5000  words) should be formatted according  to the instructions
available  at  the workshop  website. All  submitted
papers will  be reviewed by  the programme committee.  Accepted papers
will be collected in informal  workshop notes, printed copies of which
will  be available  at the  workshop.  To  accommodate  the publishing
needs of different scientific communities, we stress that authors will
retain  the   copyright  of  their  papers  and   that  submitting  to
COMSOC-2008 does  not preclude publication  of the same material  in a
journal  or   in  archival  conference   proceedings.   Submission  is
restricted  to one  paper per  principal author  (each  accepted paper
should be presented by a different author).  Please contact either one
of the programme chairs in case of any questions:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> Ulle Endriss  (ulle@illc.uva.nl) </li>
 <li> Paul Goldberg (p.w.goldberg@liverpool.ac.uk) </li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>OPEN PROBLEM SESSION</h2>
<hr>

<p>
We  plan to  hold an  Open Problem  Session during  COMSOC-2008, where
participants can  present and discuss  some of the problems  that they
consider important in  our field.  To facilitate this,  we will accept
submissions of  two-page problem  descriptions, which will  be lightly
reviewed  and included  in  the workshop  notes. Problem  descriptions
should be submitted  by email by 20 June 2008 to  one of the programme
chairs. Please use the same file format as for regular papers.
</p>

<hr>
<h2>TUTORIALS</h2>
<hr>

<p>
Given  the  interdisciplinary nature  of  the  field of  computational
social choice, hardly any researcher  can be expected to have received
formal training in  all of its subfields. For the  day just before the
workshop, we hope to be able to offer several tutorials, aimed at both
students and  senior researchers. These tutorials  will cover material
from  computer science  of  interest to  social  choice theorists  and
material   from  social   choice  theory   of  interest   to  computer
scientists. Details will be announced as they become available.
</p>


<hr>
<h2>CO-LOCATED EVENT</h2>
<hr>

<p>
COMSOC-2008 will  take place immediately  after a workshop  on "Market
Based Control",  supported by the EPSRC-funded  "Market Based Control"
project   (http://www.marketbasedcontrol.com).    This  meeting   will
feature talks by several  guest speakers (inlcuding Sarit Kraus, David
Parkes and  Peter Stone),  and COMSOC-2008 participants  are cordially
invited to attend.
