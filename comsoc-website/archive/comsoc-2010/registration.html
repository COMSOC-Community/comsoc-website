<h1>Registration</h1>

<!--<p>To be announced.</p>
-->
<p>
The registration fee is &euro;30 for (PhD) students,
and &euro;75 for everybody else. This covers access to 
all talks (including the LogICCC Tutorial Day), lunches, coffee breaks, and a copy of the informal proceedings.
We are also planning a <a href="dinner.shtml">social dinner</a>
which needs to be paid for separately (&euro;30).
If you are accompanied by someone who doesn't pay the registration fee
but who wants to join us for the conference dinner, please mention this
in the comments field during registration and pay an additional amount
of &euro;55 (which is the real price of the conference dinner) for that
person.
</p>

<p>
Please register by <b>15 July 2010</b>.
Late registration is possible (at the same price), but for registrations 
received after this date we cannot promise to have enough copies of the
workshop notes available, and we may also be short of places for the
social dinner. 
</p>

<p>
To register, please fill in the 
<a href="form.shtml">registration form</a>.
The registration fee has to be paid by bank transfer within one week after the registration. 
The bank account details will be provided during the registration process.
<!--Please pay the registration fee (<i>in cash</i>) on arrival at the 
workshop site. Students, please bring suitable proof of your student 
status with you.
-->
</p>
