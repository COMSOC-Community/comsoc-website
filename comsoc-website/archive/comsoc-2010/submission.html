<h1>Paper Submission</h1>
<!--
<p>To be announced.</p>

<p>
<i>Thanks to everyone who submitted. We have received ?? papers. Submission is now closed.</i>
</p>
-->
<p>
Authors are invited to submit full papers not exceeding 12 pages in length
(roughly 5000 words; including the references).  A clearly marked appendix
is allowed but the main body of the paper must be able to stand on its own
and reading the appendix is entirely at the discretion of the program
committee.  Note that appendices will not be printed in the workshop
proceedings. Therefore, we encourage keeping key technical proofs in
the body of the paper.
</p>

<p>
Each paper should include a title, the names and contact details 
of all authors, and 
a short abstract of 100-300 words. 
When preparing your submission, please follow these 
<a href="submission/sample.pdf">formatting instructions</a>. The easiest way of 
doing this is to use the <a href="http://www.latex-project.org">Latex</a> document 
preparation system with the class file <a href="submission/comsoc2010.cls">comsoc2010.cls</a>.
The formatting instructions are based on a sample file (<a href="submission/sample.tex">sample.tex</a>), 
which you can use as a starting point for your own paper.
</p>

<p>
Paper submission is electronic. To submit, please prepare a PDF file 
of your paper, a short abstract in plain text, and a list of two to five 
keywords. Then follow this link:

<a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=comsoc2010">
Enter the COMSOC-2010 Paper Submission and Reviewing System!</a>
</td></tr></table>
</center>
</p>

<p>
You will be able to revise your submission any number of times before 
the deadline (of <strike>15th May 2010</strike> <font color="#FF0000">22th May 2010</font>, midnight Hawaiian time). 
</p>

<p>
It is expected that the corresponding author (not necessarily the
first author) will attend the workshop and deliver the talk.  If
unforeseen circumstances make this impossible, then another co-author
of the paper may give the talk, under the condition that this
co-author is not already giving another talk.  If none of the
co-authors can give the talk, then the paper must be withdrawn by
1st July 2010 the latest.
</p>

<p>
Please feel free to <a href="contact.shtml">contact</a> 
the organizers with any questions you may have.
