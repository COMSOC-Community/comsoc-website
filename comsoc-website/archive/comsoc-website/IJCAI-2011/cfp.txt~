CALL FOR PAPERS:
IJCAI Workshop on Social Choice and Artificial Intelligence
Barcelona, ?? July 2011 (part of the IJCAI-2011 workshop programme)

**********************************************************************
	
The  IJCAI Workshop on  Social Choice  and Artificial  Intelligence is
part  of  the  workshop  programme  of the  22nd  International  Joint
Conference  on Artificial  Intelligence  (IJCAI-2011), to  be held  in
Barcelona  in July  2011.  We  invite submissions  on  all aspects  of
computational  social choice,  particularly contributions  focusing on
questions at the interface of social choice and AI and position papers
addressing new challenges and research directions for our field.

**********************************************************************
TOPICS OF INTEREST
**********************************************************************

Social  choice  theory  is  the  study of  mechanisms  for  collective
decision  making,  such as  election  systems  or  protocols for  fair
division.  Computational  social  choice  addresses  problems  at  the
interface  of social choice  theory with  computer science,  either by
using concepts and methods from social choice theory to solve problems
arising in  computer science  (such as webpage  ranking), or  by using
techniques from computer science to solve (or reformulate) problems of
social  choice  (such  as  designing  social  choice  rules  that  are
computationally hard to manipulate).

We  welcome  submissions  on   all  aspects  of  computational  social
choice.  On top  of this,  we specifically  invite papers  focusing on
questions at the interface of social choice and AI. Topics of interest
will therefore include, but not be limited to:

* Social  Choice, Knowledge  Representation  and Automated  Reasoning:
  What  are  suitable languages  to  formally  and compactly  describe
  social choice problems? How do  we best reason about these problems?
  What automated  reasoning techniques are available to  verify that a
  given social choice procedure satisfies a given property and to what
  extent can  we automatically verify  or discover theorems  in social
  choice theory?

* Social  Choice, Search,  Planning and  Constraints: How  do  we best
  exploit techniques  developed in AI search,  planning and constraint
  programming to solve  computationally intractable problems in social
  choice?

* Social Choice and Multiagent Systems: How should we adapt the formal
  apparatus developed in social  choice theory to model group decision
  making  amongst autonomous  software agents  (e.g., in  view  of how
  preferences are modelled,  what properties of aggregation procedures
  are desirable,  etc.)? What are  best practices for  applying social
  choice techniques in multiagent systems?

* Social Choice and Uncertainty:  What can approaches developed in the
  Uncertainty  in AI  community contribute  to the  problem  of making
  collective  choices when various  parameters of  the decision  to be
  made   are  uncertain   (e.g.,  incomplete   preferences,  uncertain
  consequences of collective decisions, etc.)?

* Social  Choice and  AI  Applications: How  can computational  social
  choice benefit application areas that are widely studied in AI, such
  as recommender systems, Internet search engines, question answering,
  ontology merging, and more?

**********************************************************************
PAPER SUBMISSION AND PROCEEDINGS
**********************************************************************

We invite  the submission  of technical papers  (up to 6  pages, IJCAI
format) describing  original and unpublished work as  well as position
papers  (up to  2 pages,  IJCAI format)  discussing open  problems and
research  challenges or  outlining new  directions for  our  field. We
specifically   welcome   technical  papers   reporting   on  work   in
progress. Position  papers will be evaluated on  their originality and
perceived   appeal   to  the   target   audience   of  the   workshop;
interdisciplinary work is especially welcome.

All submissions will be  reviewed by the programme committee. Accepted
contributions will  be included in the informal  workshop notes, which
will be  distributed at the workshop  (in electronic form).  We do not
plan  to edit formally  published proceedings.  Instead, we  hope that
authors will be able to use the feedback received during the reviewing
process  and  the  workshop  itself  when  preparing  their  work  for
submission to an archival conference or a journal at a later time.

Details regarding the submission procedure and formatting instructions
are available at the workshop website.
