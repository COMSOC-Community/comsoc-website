<h1>Call for Papers</h1>

<p>
<i>The full Call for Papers is also available in <a href="cfp.txt">text format</a></i>.
</p>

<p>We  welcome  submissions  on   all  aspects  of  computational  social
choice.  On top  of this,  we specifically  invite papers  focusing on
questions at the interface of social choice and AI. Topics of interest
will therefore include, but not be limited to:

<ul>
<li><i>Social  Choice, Knowledge  Representation  and Automated  Reasoning:</i>
  What  are  suitable languages  to  formally  and compactly  describe
  social choice problems? How do  we best reason about these problems?
  What automated  reasoning techniques are available to  verify that a
  given social choice procedure satisfies a given property and to what
  extent can  we automatically verify  or discover theorems  in social
  choice theory?</li>
<li><i>Social  Choice, Search,  Planning and  Constraints:</i> How  do  we best
  exploit techniques  developed in AI search,  planning and constraint
  programming to solve  computationally intractable problems in social
  choice?</li>
<li><i>Social Choice and Multiagent Systems:</i> How should we adapt the formal
  apparatus developed in social  choice theory to model group decision
  making  amongst autonomous  software agents  (e.g., in  view  of how
  preferences are modelled,  what properties of aggregation procedures
  are desirable,  etc.)? What are  best practices for  applying social
  choice techniques in multiagent systems?</li>
<li><i>Social Choice and Uncertainty:</i>  What can approaches developed in the
  Uncertainty  in AI  community contribute  to the  problem  of making
  collective  choices when various  parameters of  the decision  to be
  made   are  uncertain   (e.g.,  incomplete   preferences,  uncertain
  consequences of collective decisions, etc.)?</li>
<li><i>Social  Choice and  AI  Applications:</i> How  can computational  social
  choice benefit application areas that are widely studied in AI, such
  as recommender systems, Internet search engines, question answering,
  ontology merging, and more?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>We invite  the submission  of technical papers describing  original and unpublished work as  well as position papers   discussing open  problems and
research  challenges or  outlining new  directions for  our  field. We
specifically   welcome   technical  papers   reporting   on  work   in
progress. Position  papers will be evaluated on  their originality and
perceived   appeal   to  the   target   audience   of  the   workshop;
interdisciplinary work is especially welcome.
</p>

<p>All submissions will be  reviewed by the programme committee. Accepted
contributions will  be included in the informal  workshop notes, which
will be  distributed at the workshop  (in electronic form).  We do not
plan  to edit formally  published proceedings.  Instead, we  hope that
authors will be able to use the feedback received during the reviewing
process  and  the  workshop  itself  when  preparing  their  work  for
submission to an archival conference or a journal at a later time.
