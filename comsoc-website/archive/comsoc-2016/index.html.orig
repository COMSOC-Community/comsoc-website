<h1>About COMSOC-2016 ...</h1>



<p>Computational social choice is a rapidly growing discipline at the 
interface  of  social  choice  theory  and  computer  science.  It  is 
concerned with the application  of  computational  techniques  to  the 
study of social choice mechanisms, and with the integration of  social 
choice paradigms into computing

<p>The Sixth International Workshop on Computational Social Choice
(COMSOC-2016) will take place on June 22&ndash;24, 2016, in Toulouse, France.
It will be hosted by the 
<a href="http://www.irit.fr" target="_blank">Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse (IRIT)</a>
 of the
<a href="http://www.univ-toulouse.fr" target="_blank">University of Toulouse</a>.
The aim of the workshop is to bring together different communities:
computer scientists interested  in  computational  issues  in 
social choice; people working in artificial  intelligence  and
multiagent systems who are using  ideas  from  social  choice  to  organize 
societies of artificial software agents; logicians interested  in  the 
logic-based specification and analysis of  social  procedures; 
computer science theorists analyzing algorithmic properties of social phenomena;
and last but not least people  coming  from  social  choice 
theory itself: economists, mathematicians, and political scientists.</p>

(DFG)</a> and will be held in association and co-located with the 
<a href="http://cost-ic0602.org">COST Action "Algorithmic Decision Theory"</a> 
(which will support some of its members to attend COMSOC-2012).
COMSOC-2012 will also  be  accompanied  by  a
<a href="tutorial.html">"LogICCC tutorial  day"</a> with general introductory talks.
This event, as part of the European Science Foundation EUROCORES Programme LogICCC 
(read more about the
<a href="http://www.esf.org/activities/eurocores/running-programmes/logiccc.html">LogICCC Programme</a> of the <a href ="http://www.esf.org/">European Science Foundation</a>), 
is supported by funds from AKA, DASTI, DFG, FCT, FWF, FNRS, GACR, ISF, MICINN, NWO, NZZ, T&Uuml;BITAK, and VR.
The <a href="invited.html">invited talks</a>
of the workshop and the <a href="tutorial.html">tutorials</a> will be 
presented  by  a  number  of
prominent  scientists.  Registration fees will cover both the workshop
and the LogICCC tutorial day and will be kept very low.</p>

<p>COMSOC-2012 is generously funded by several organizations and
private companies, which will allow  us  to  bring in a number of prominent  scientists as
<a href="invited.html">invited speakers</a>, whilst 
keeping registration fees very low.</p>
