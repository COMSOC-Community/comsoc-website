<h1>Paper Submission</h1>



<!--
<p>
<i>Thanks to everyone who submitted. We have accepted 38 out of 54 papers.
It is now time to submit camera-ready versions of your papers.</i>
</p>
-->

<!--
<h1 style="color:red">Resubmission Extension</h1>
<p>
By request of several authors, we will keep the submission server open during the weekend for
you to update your paper.
Please submit your then-most-current version of your paper by the deadline so that we can
make an informed decision regarding the assignment of the papers to reviewers. You will be
able to revise the paper until early Monday in Europe.
</p>
-->



<p>
The <strong>camera-ready version</strong> of accepted papers can be uploaded on the Easychair submission webpage, following the same requirements for submission as detailed below.
</p>
<p>
Regular papers should not exceed 12 pages in length, excluding references, contact information and a clearly-marked appendix of arbitrary length that will be read at the
discretion of the PC members. When preparing your submission, please follow these <a href="submission/comsoc16.pdf">formatting instructions</a>. The easiest way of doing so is to use the Latex typesetting system with the class file <a href="submission/comsoc2016.cls">comsoc2016.cls</a>. The formatting instructions are based on a sample file (<a href="submission/comsoc16.tex">comsoc16.tex</a>), which you can use as a starting point for your own paper.

<p>
You will be able to revise your submission any number of times before 
the deadline (15 March).
</p>


<p>
All submitted papers will be reviewed by the program committee. Accepted papers will be collected in informal workshop notes that will not be printed. To accomodate the publishing needs of different scientific communities, we stress that authors will retain the copyright of their papers and that submitting to COMSOC-2016 does not preclude publication of the same material in a journal or in a conference with formal proceedings. Submission of regular papers is restricted by the rule that a single person can present at most one paper at the workshop.
</p>

<p>
COMSOC-2016 will also include a <strong>poster session</strong>. Posters will be selected based on abstracts of up to 250 words, which can be sent by email to <a href="mailto:comsoc.toulouse@gmail.com">comsoc.toulouse@gmail.com</a>, with the subject "COMSOC-16 poster submission", anytime before 18 May 2016. In the body of this email, please indicate whether you want to present at the Industry Day, at COMSOC, or both. Unlike regular papers, a single author is allowed to present multiple posters. 
</p>

<p>
Please feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact</a> 
the organizers with any questions you may have. 
</p>







<!--commented stuff
<p style="color: red">Please suppress page numbering in your 
camera-ready papers. (The style-file should do this automatically.)

<p>
Paper submission is electronic.

<p>
It is expected that the corresponding author (not necessarily the
first author) will attend the workshop and deliver the talk.  If
unforeseen circumstances make this impossible, then another co-author
of the paper may give the talk, under the condition that this
co-author is not already giving another talk.  If none of the
co-authors can give the talk, then the paper must be withdrawn by
10th July 2012 at the latest.
