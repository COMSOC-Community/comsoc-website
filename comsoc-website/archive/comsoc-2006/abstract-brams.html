<b>Better Ways to Cut a Cake</b>
</p>

<p>
Procedures to divide a cake among <i>n</i> people with <i>n</i>-1 cuts (the minimum number) 
are analyzed and compared.  For 2 persons, cut-and-choose, while envy-free and efficient, 
limits the cutter to exactly 50% if he or she is ignorant of the chooser's preferences, 
whereas the chooser can generally obtain more.  By comparison, a new 2-person surplus 
procedure (SP), which induces the players to be truthful in order to maximize their 
minimum allocations, leads to a <i>proportionally equitable</i> division of the surplus -- 
the part that remains after each player receives 50% -- by giving each person exactly 
the same proportion of the surplus as he or she values it.
For <i>n</i> &ge; 3 persons, a new equitable procedure (EP) yields a 
<i>maximally equitable</i> division of a cake.  This division gives all players the 
highest common value that they can achieve and induces truthfulness, but it may not be 
envy-free. The applicability of SP and EP to the fair division of a heterogeneous, 
divisible good, like land, is briefly discussed.

<b>Voting Systems that Combine Approval and Preference</b>
</p>

<p>
Information on the rankings and information on the approval of candidates in an election, though related, are fundamentally different-one cannot be derived from the other. Both kinds of information are important in the determination of social choices. We propose a way of combining them in two hybrid voting systems, <i>preference approval voting</i> (PAV) and <i>fallback voting</i> (FV), that satisfy several desirable properties, including monotonicity.
</p>

<p>
Both systems may give different winners from standard ranking and nonranking voting systems. PAV, especially, encourages candidates to take coherent majoritarian positions, but it is more information-demanding than FV. PAV and FV are manipulable through voters' contracting or expanding their approval sets, but a 3-candidate dynamic poll model suggests that Condorcet winners, and candidates ranked first or second by the most voters if there is no Condorcet winner, will be favored, though not necessarily in equilibrium.
