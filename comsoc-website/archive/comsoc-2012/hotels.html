<h1>Travel</h1>

<br>

<h2> Flying to Krak&oacute;w</h2>

<p>
Krak&oacute;w has an <a 
href="http://www.krakowairport.pl/en">international 
airport</a> (KRK) with direct connections to various cities, 
operating both regular airlines and budget airlines.
From the airport you can either take a train to the
Krakow Glowny railway station (marked as "Railway Station" on the
map on the bottom of this page) or you can
take suburban bus line 292 (the ride will take about 25--30 minutes)
and get off at one of the following stops:
<ul>
  <li> "Cracovia" bus stop; relatively close to the Main Market Square.
  <li> "AGH" bus stop; at the main building of the AGH University (we
  recommend this stop if you are going to OLIMP Hostel).
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Bus tickets can be bought from the RELAY newsagent's shop at
the airport. Sometimes there are also ticket machines in the buses
or one can buy the ticket from the driver, but the drivers rarely 
have the tickets and the ticket machines require change. 
</p>

<p>You can also take a taxi from the airport. You should expect to 
pay between 100--150pln if you use a taxi from the airport-based
company or somewhat less if you call for a taxi (e.g., Taxi
Barbakan, (+48) 12 196 61).
</p>
<br>


<h2>
Flying to Katowice
</h2>

<p>
Katowice is large, industrial city located about 70km from Krakow.
Some airlines (in particular, some budget airline) offer <a 
href="http://www.katowice-airport.com/en/index/index/0">Katowice
Pyrzowice Airport</a> (KTW) as the airport for Krakow. 
There is a number of buses and mini-bus operators that provide
transport between Krakow city center and the airport (see the
airport website or the <a href="http://www.matuszek.com.pl/transfery_en.html">following operator</a>).
</p>
<br>


<h2>Taking the Train</h2>

<p>
If you take the train, you should get off at the "Krakow Glowny"
station. The station is located right on the edge of the
Main Market Square area and you can either walk from there
or take a taxi. If you are heading to OLIMP Hostel, you can
catch Tram line 13 (see the description of Kazimierz area
for information about the tram).
</p>


<br><br>

<h1>Accommodation in Krakow</h1>

<br>

<h2> OLIMP Hostel (on campus)</h2>
<p>
We have reserved a number of rooms in a student-quality
hostel <a 
href="http://www.booking.com/hotel/pl/olimp-hostel.html?aid=311097;label=olimp-hostel-9dj14Bl4gWS3nJvjRfNT9gS7074654977%3Apl%3Ata%3Ap1%3Ap2%3Aac%3Aap2t1%3Aneg;sid=a434f1f8757dce9c569872d27735b03f;dcid=1&lang=en-us">OLIMP</a>
located very close to the Workshop venue (about a 10 minute walk) and the
downtown (25-30 minute walk). 
You can book a room in the hostel through the <a 
href="registration.shtml">registration page</a>.
</p>

<br>


<h2> Polonez Hotel (on campus) <b style="color: red">New option!</b></h2>

<p>A small number of rooms became available in the Polonez hotel on campus. 
Polonez is a 3-star hotel located very close to the workshop venue (a 5 minute
walk) and downtown (15-20 minute walk). Booking is possible through the
<a href="registration.shtml">registration page</a>.
</p>

<br><br>


<h2>Staying in the Downtown Krakow</h2>

<p>You may prefer to stay closer to downtown Krakow (the Main Market 
Square area) or Kazimierz (the Jewish District of Krakow). We have not
booked hotels or hostels in that area, but you can easily find a number
of small hotels and hostels of various price and comfort levels.
</p>

<p><b>Main Market Square area</b>, the main touristic part of Krakow, 
both the historical and modern center of the city, is located about
20-30 minute walk from the Workshop venue. There is a number of hotels
and hostels in the area, as well as apartments to rent (see the
section below for some information on renting apartments).
The area is filled with restaurants, cafes, museums (including the
possibility of going <a 
href="http://www.museums.krakow.travel/en/muzea/id,440,title,underground-of-the-main-market-square.html">under 
the Main Market Square</a>), and historical churches, etc.
<p>

<p>
Some hotels in this area are listed below (note that the hotels are 
often quite small and thus please book early; fortunately there are many
hotels so if these are booked, please look for further ones or
contanct us):
<ul>
  <li> <a 
href="http://www.booking.com/hotel/pl/hotelfortunakrakow.en-us.html?sid=a434f1f8757dce9c569872d27735b03f;dcid=1"> 
Fortuna Hotel</a>, Czapskich 5. Nice hotel conveniently located between in 
the center, but relatively
close to the AGH University. 
  <li> <a 
href="http://www.booking.com/hotel/pl/saski-krakow.en-us.html?sid=a434f1f8757dce9c569872d27735b03f;dcid=1">
Hotel Saski</a>, Slawkowska 3. A nice, stylish 3-star hotel.
  <li> <a 
href="http://www.booking.com/hotel/pl/polski-pod-bialym-orlem.en-us.html?sid=a434f1f8757dce9c569872d27735b03f;dcid=1">
   Hotel Polski Pod Bialym Orlem</a>, Pijarska 17. A nice hotel located
   right at the old city walls.
</ul>
</p>

There are also some luxurious hotels such as <a 
href="http://www.sheraton.pl/krakow/en">Sheraton Krakow</a>.

<br>
<br>

<p><b>Kazimierz area</b> was traditionally the Jewish district
of Krakow.  Nowadays, while maintaining the atmosphere, it has
become a lively center for restaurants, cafes, clubs, art shops,
museums (including <a href="http://www.oskarschindlersfactory.com/">Schindler's Factory 
museum</a>) etc. Kazimierz is located about 15 minute walk away from the
Main Market Square area. Thus, while a walk from Kazimierz to
the Workshop venue leads through pleasant neighborhoods, it
might be inconveniently long and we recommend using <a 
href="http://www.mpk.krakow.pl/en/">public
transport</a>:
<ul>
<li> Tram Line 13 goes through Starowislna Street, then
goes around the Main Market Square, passes through Karmelicka Street,
and reaches "Urzednicza" tram stop. 
<li> From "Urzednicza" tram stop  one can reach the Workshop
venue in 5-10 minutes.
<li> The tram ride taks 10-15 minutes.
<li> Ticket prices:
  <ul>
    <li> Single Ride: 3.20pln
    <li> Two Rides: 6pln
    <li> Day Pass: 12pln
    <li> 3-Days Pass: 30pln
    <li> Week Pass: 40pln
  </ul>
</ul>

Some hotels in this area are:

<ul>
  <li> <a 
href="http://www.booking.com/hotel/pl/estercracow.en-us.html?sid=a434f1f8757dce9c569872d27735b03f;dcid=1">Hotel 
Ester</a>, Szeroka 20, a 4-star hotel located at Szeroka street ("Wide 
street"), one of the very characteristic spots of Kazimierz.

  <li> <a 
href="http://www.booking.com/hotel/pl/edencracow.en-us.html?sid=a434f1f8757dce9c569872d27735b03f;dcid=1">Hotel 
Eden</a>, ul. Ciemna 15, a hotel located right in the heart of historical
Kazimierz (has a kosher restaurant, but individual guests need to 
preorder meals). 
</ul>

There is also a large number of small hotels/hostels/apartment rentals
in the area.


<br>

<h2> Renting Apartments in Krakow</h2>

In addition to usual hotel-booking, a number of private owners
and small businesses offer apartments to rent in Krakow. 
The prices are often lower than in hotels and differ depending
on the location and size of the apartments. Usually the most
convenient way is to share a single apartment. One of the
most convenient ways to find an apartment is to use "noce.pl"
website:
<ul>
  <li> <a 
href="https://www.noce.pl/SR/index2.php?lang=en&k=1&pk=2">Noce.pl</a>
</ul>

Red Kurka apartments are a bit more up-scale, but offer much higher
quality than typical apartments for rent:
