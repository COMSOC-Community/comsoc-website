<h1 style="color:red">Resubmission Extension</h1>
<p>
By request of several authors, we will keep the submission server open during the weekend for
you to update your paper.
Please submit your then-most-current version of your paper by the deadline so that we can
make an informed decision regarding the assignment of the papers to reviewers. You will be
able to revise the paper until early Monday in Europe.
</p>
-->

<h1>Paper Submission</h1>
<!--
<p>To be announced.</p>

<p>
<i>Thanks to everyone who submitted. We have received ?? papers. Submission is now closed.</i>
</p>
-->

<p>
Authors are invited to submit full papers not exceeding 12 pages in length
(roughly 5000 words; including the references).  A clearly marked appendix
is allowed but the main body of the paper must be able to stand on its own
and reading the appendix is entirely at the discretion of the program
committee.  Note that appendices will not be printed in the workshop
proceedings. Therefore, we encourage keeping key technical proofs in
the body of the paper.
</p>

<p>
Each paper should include a title, the names and contact details 
of all authors, and 
a short abstract of 100-300 words. 
When preparing your submission, please follow these 
<a href="submission/sample.pdf">formatting instructions</a>. The easiest way of 
doing this is to use the <a href="http://www.latex-project.org">Latex</a> document 
preparation system with the class file <a href="submission/comsoc2012.cls">comsoc2012.cls</a>.
The formatting instructions are based on a sample file (<a href="submission/sample.tex">sample.tex</a>), 
which you can use as a starting point for your own paper.
</p>

<p>
Paper submission is electronic. To submit, please prepare a PDF file 
of your paper, a short abstract in plain text, and a list of two to five 
keywords.

</td></tr></table>
</center>
</p>



<p>
You will be able to revise your submission any number of times before 
the deadline.
</p>

<p>
It is expected that the corresponding author (not necessarily the
first author) will attend the workshop and deliver the talk.  If
unforeseen circumstances make this impossible, then another co-author
of the paper may give the talk, under the condition that this
co-author is not already giving another talk.  If none of the
co-authors can give the talk, then the paper must be withdrawn by
1st July 2012 the latest.
</p>

<p>
Please feel free to <a href="contact.shtml">contact</a> 
the organizers with any questions you may have.
