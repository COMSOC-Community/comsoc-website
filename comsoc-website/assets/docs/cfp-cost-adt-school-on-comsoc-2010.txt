CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

The European Science Foundation's  COST Action on Algorithmic Decision
Theory will  sponsor a doctoral school on  Computational Social Choice
during 9-14 April 2010 in Estoril, near Lisbon, Portugal.

All interested PhD  students (as well as junior  postdocs and advanced
MSc students)  working in fields such as  Computational Social Choice,
(classical) Social Choice Theory  and related branches of Mathematical
Economics,   Multiagent  Systems,   Artificial   Intelligence,  Logic,
Theoretical  Computer  Science, as  well  as  Operations Research  and
Decision Analysis, are  encouraged to apply (by submitting  a CV and a
short cover letter).

The  doctoral  school can  accommodate  up  to  30 participants.   The
registration fee  is EUR 225  (full pension).  Applications  should be
received by the end of January  2010. To apply, please email the local
organisers at figueira@ist.utl.pt (Jose Rui Figueira).

The programme will consist of three  courses (3 x 90min each) and five
invited  talks (90min  each).  On  top of  this, there  will  be ample
opportunity  for participants to  present their  own work  and receive
feedback. The three courses are:

* Christian Klamler (University of Graz, AT)
  Introduction to Social Choice and Voting / Geometry of Voting

* Jerome Lang (CNRS and LAMSADE, Univ. Paris-Dauphine, FR)
  Computational and Communicational Aspects of Voting

* Ulle Endriss (ILLC, University of Amsterdam, NL)
  Fair Division

The five invited talks are:

* Jose Rui Figueira (IST, Technical University of Lisbon, PT)
  History of Social Choice Theory

* Felix Brandt (University of Munich, DE)
  From Arrow's Impossibility to Schwartz's Tournament Equilibrium Set

* Sebastien Konieczny (CNRS and CRIL, Univ. Artois, FR)
  Information Fusion and Social Choice 

* Thierry Marchant (Ghent University, BE)
  From Social Choice to Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis 

* Stefano Moretti (LAMSADE, Univ. Paris-Dauphine, FR)
  Power Indices and Game Theory (with Applications in Bioinformatics)

The doctoral school will start on  Friday 9 April 2010 after lunch and
end on Wednesday 14 April  2010 with lunch. For further information on
