# The COMSOC Community

The international community of researchers in computational social choice 
is made up of a diverse group of individuals and 
defined by a common interest in the study of mechanisms for collective decision making. 
People regularly meet in person and online, at a wide variety of events.

The COMSOC community is committed to fostering an inclusive environment that values 
the contributions of individuals from all backgrounds. We believe in the strength that arises from 
a multiplicity of perspectives and experiences. Our community is dedicated to creating a space
where everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, nationality, gender identity, sexual orientation, 
(dis)ability, age, religion, or socio-economic status, feels welcome, heard, and respected. 
Every member of the community is expected to act and behave in accordance with these principles and 
to provide equal opportunities for engagement, collaboration, and advancement within our community.

## COMSOC Community on Zenodo

[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) is an open-access data repository run by CERN on behalf of the OpenAIRE programme of the European Council.
It includes a [curated list of records](https://zenodo.org/communities/comsoc) in computational social choice.
This is a good place to archive the supplementary material (consisting of data or code) of your papers. 
It makes those records visible and allows people to cite them independently from the paper itself.

## Related Research Communities

Being an interdisciplinary research field, COMSOC relates to many other research communities.
The most important of these is the (classical) social choice community, which is represented 
by the [Society for Social Choice and Welfare](https://scwsociety.org/).
